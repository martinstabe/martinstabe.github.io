<p><img src="/img/martin-stabe.jpg" style="margin: 0 12px 12px 0; max-width:150px; vertical-align:top; float:left;" />Hi! I am a data journalist living in London and working for the <em>Financial Times</em>. I manage the Interactive News desk &mdash; a team of journalists, designers and web developers who create new digital storytelling formats, including <a href="http://ig.ft.com/sites/2013/seasonal-appeal/">multimedia stories</a>,  <a href="http://www.ft.com/interactive">interactive news applications</a> and <a href="http://podcast.ft.com">podcasts</a> for the <em>FT.</em>

<p>Before joining the <em>FT</em> in 2010, I was <a href="http://www.retail-week.com/martin-stabe/1216.bio">online editor</a> of <a href="http://www.retail-week.com">Retail Week</a> magazine at <a href="http://www.emap.com">Emap</a>. I began my career in 2006 as a reporter <a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/biography.asp?contact=30">covering digital media for <em>Press Gazette</em></a>, the UK trade magazine for journalists. Sadly much of the work I did there has succumbed to link rot.</p>

<!--<p>I was an intern the London bureau of <em><a href="http://www.newsweek.com">Newsweek</a> </em>magazine, <em><a href="http://www.governing.com"><em>Governing</em></a> </em>magazine in Washington, DC, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. I also worked for <a href="http://www.palam.co.uk/">Palam Communications</a>, a public relations agency specialising in early-stage technology companies.</p>-->

<p>Born in Germany and raised in New York City, I moved to Britain in 1997. I studied journalism at <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/journalism/">City University</a>, political sociology at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk">London School of Economics</a>, and north American politics at the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk">University of Sussex</a>. I also spent some time at <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> outside Chicago.</p>

<p>An obsessive baseball fan since childhood, I played in Britain&rsquo;s top baseball league for a decade, winning three national championships with the now-defunct <a href="http://bucs.martinstabe.com/">Brighton Buccaneers</a> and later joining the <a href="http://www.londonmets.org/">London Mets</a>. This may explain my occasional outbursts of excitement when <a href="http://www.britishbaseball.org/page/show/286039-team-gb">Great Britain</a> is playing in some obscure international tournament or any European team overachieves at the World Baseball Classic.</p>

<p>You can also find me on <a href="twitter.com/martinstabe">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Martin-Stabe-922279251184719/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/martinstabe">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/MartinStabe">Github</a>.</p>
