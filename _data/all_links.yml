Anthony, president of Innosight, which consults with companies (including newspapers and automotive businesses) on how to foster a culture of innovation. He argues that the incumbents in the newspaper industry were caught sleeping during the initial meteoric growth period of Web sites like Wikipedia because the avenue for innovation — letting crowds rather than experts aggregate and filter data — seemed so antithetical to what newspapers did well.&quot;"

Granted pictures and much much bigger headlines fill much of that extra space. Yet the paper clearly provides a larger volume of local news now than it did in 1958.&quot;"

At least part of the [NCTJ] conference considered the skills survey carried out among employers and training providers, and what did the employers want of this august body - shorthand!  [D]oesn’t this rather exemplify a gulf between what’s actually going on in a landscape where all the rules of engagement are rapidly shifting and what’s perceived to be the issues within (still largely print-centric) newsrooms?&quot; (Amen.)"

They no longer have the luxury, in an information-overload world, of wasting readers’ time with non-stories or information readers already know. ... Filler news can take many forms. ... I would add: many stories based on (or directly lifted from) press releases; one-sentence news like stock market updates, shuttle takeoffs, and incremental updates of previous stories; many politics-as-process stories.&quot; (HT: Patrick Smith)"

  post_content: "&quot;[T]he Trinity Mirror-owned Teesside Gazette is recruiting 70 school students as bloggers for its post-code level network of news channels on GazetteLive.co.uk as part of a new vocational course. Trinity has linked-up with Stockton Schools to help create a new Creative &amp; Media diploma to launch in September for students aged 14 to 19, and plans are “in place” to extend the scheme beyond Stockton. It’s not a work experience lark for the kids; neither is it cheap labour for Trinity: the new diploma will be equivalent to between five and seven GCSEs or three and a half A-levels if they take the advanced version.&quot;"

The total haul from news on the Web is not nearly sufficient to support everything that goes into reporting and presenting it. The reason for this has nothing to do with Google and everything to do with a la carte pricing. ... The perceived value of individual pieces of content is much less than the perceived value of an entire HBO subscription, album, or magazine.&quot;"

Another word for this is blogging, or at least what blogging might be after it matures—meaning, after it transcends its current status as a free-fire zone and settles into a more comprehensive system of gathering and presenting information. As a result, although its self-marketing subtly sells a kind of sleek, mid-last-century Concorde-flying sangfroid, The Economist has reached its current level of influence and importance because it is, in every sense of the word, a true global digest for an age when the amount of undigested, undigestible information online continues to metastasize. And that’s a very good place to be in 2009. ... Tellingly, the very lo-fi digest The Week, which has copped The Economist’s attitude without any real reporting or analysis at all, is thriving as well.&quot;"

The total cost to the public purse of councils getting into the publishing business? Around £10 million a year in London alone.&quot;"

You analyze a database as part of the reporting process, but you don&amp;#39;t want to clog up a story with too many numbers. The ability to add details online has changed this process. Data has become a part of the story. And that&amp;#39;s the key connection between CAR and programming in journalism: data.&quot;"

  post_content: "&quot;An advertising slump has hit local newspapers much harder than national papers or other media (see chart). The growing reach of national brands like Rightmove and Auto Trader means that local papers have lost their grip on property and car advertising. Most painful has been the disappearance of job ads. Public-sector recruitment has shifted mostly to official websites in the past few years, and recession has eroded the rest. In July 1999 an edition of the Echo carried 17 pages of job advertisements. The final issue had one-fifth of one page.&quot;"

  post_content: "&quot;I have—in nine months of conversation with Murdoch, writing his biography after he bought the Journal, in 2007— often argued the nature of Internet culture with him to little avail. Murdoch can almost single-handedly take apart and re-assemble a complex printing press, but his digital-technology acumen and interest is practically zero. Murdoch’s abiding love of newspapers has turned into a personal antipathy to the Internet: for him it’s a place for porn, thievery, and hackers.&quot;"

In addition to the advantages listed above, it’s also easy to “install.” If you can download files, unzip them and move them to a location on your hard drive, you can “install” SQLite. If you can install a Firefox add-on, you can manage it in the browser. And you can take your database files home with you or email them around. The add-on supports importing CSV files, SQL dumps and XML (although all databases can have issues with importing XML). It looks and works the same on a PC or a Mac. Most importantly, it demands an understanding of SQL that you can avoid when learning Access.&quot;"

The publishing community must begin to think about building emotional connections like these in our day-to-day work. This is not a sideline to our business model: it is in the center.&quot;"

  post_content: "&quot;technical issues are definitely a barrier, and staff from several newsrooms told me that their print-era content management systems don’t handle links well. There’s also no standard format for filing a story with hyperlinks — copy might be drafted in Microsoft Word, but links are unlikely to survive being repeatedly emailed, cut and pasted, and squeeze through any number of different systems. But technical obstacles don’t much matter if reporters don’t value links enough to write them into their stories. In conversations with staff members from various newsrooms, I’ve frequently heard that cultural issues are a barrier. When paper is seen as the primary product, adding good links feels like extra work for the reporter, rather than an essential part of the storytelling form.&quot;"

That’s the level that many economists consider sustainable for the deficit, because one year’s normal economic growth can pay off the previous year’s budget shortfall.&quot;"

We may be approaching a tipping point, however, driven by the rise of social media. There are a raft of startups using people’s social networks to create personalised news feeds ... The problem with the Daily Me approach to filtering is that it only gives you information about things you tell it you’re interested in. The serendipity of newspapers — the way you find yourself reading about an issue or a sector you didn’t know you were interested in — is lost. But by tapping into the interests of your social graph, you tap into all their interests and serendipity is restored.&quot;"

  post_content: "Ken Doctor: &quot;Though the FT and the Wall Street Journal have long operated successful pay models, the Times’ leap is a big one: The Times isn’t mainly a business newspaper. If it can succeed charging readers for “general news,” that’s a milestone for newspapers around the world. ...We know that the vast majority of visitors won’t reach the 20-article-view level and won’t bump into the fence. They are fodder for advertising, and a slim few will become more regular users over time. Then, there’s that small percentage — one to three percent — who do pay for digital-only subscriptions, in addition, of course to the print subscribers who will now get &amp;#039;all-access&amp;#039; ... How open the Times will be to social traffic is a big consideration, as social traffic is the fastest growing source of all traffic, and represents a more engaged audience than search-driven visitors.&quot;"

Many of the biggest Twitter accounts are big media brands such as CNN and Time, but the study suggests Twitter’s active users actually tend to prefer individuals over outlets. So while the average follower of @NYTimes has six followers themselves, individual journalists have followers who boast a median following count of around 100. That gives individual journalists — who are also, the study says, more likely to link to a multiplicity of sources — a much wider and more influential network of connections.&quot;"

The New Yorker&amp;#039;s stated goal of generating engagement on its page couldn&amp;#039;t be more sensible, especially as the literary brand, which once seemed to regard its website as though it were a misplaced umlaut that made it into print, invests more and more in its digital operation through its iPad app, blogs and podcasts. &quot;"

Unless they happen to be another Natalie Massanet or a brand like Sony that has its own editorial team, the chances are the answer is no. The content generated on Facebook and other branded content ventures cannot be sales or PR driven; it has to be more subtle than that. It needs to reflect the lifestyle choices of the brand’s target audience. ...

It allows experts to find an interested audience, and those who witness world-changing events ...

It was in Dutch sadly. But with the help of followers on Twitter I soon had a translation. Mr Landmeter had built a bunker in Brega in 1988. In the interview he gave the exact coordinates for the location of the bunker.&quot;"

In the U.S., by contrast, many states have strong privacy laws, but they are loosely enforced because the U.S. media is, on the whole, more likely to self-censor — something that baffles many British journalists.&quot;"

And an avalanche was triggered. Five months later, Clive Goodman was arrested. So how did I know that this might be the answer? Because, as ITV’s Royal Correspondent (a post I held a few years previously) I had heard that this was an absolutely routine way of doing business in tabloid newspapers.

And what about the tape in which we heard Charles asking Camilla if he could be re-incarnated as her tampax? One can only suspect that someone, somewhere did a lot worse than hacking voice messages.&quot;"

Secondly, as it's sourced from thousands of technicians - and humans make mistakes - it was littered with errors. There were plenty of cars registered in the 1800s and a few steam-powered Renault Clios to boot.

While previous work has relied on articles' early performance to predict their popularity over their remaining lifespan, Bandari et al focused on predicting their popularity even before they're formulated in the first place. The researchers have developed a tool that allows people -- and, in particular, news organizations -- to calibrate their content in advance of their posting and tweeting, creating stuff that's optimized for maximum attention and impact. That tool allows for the forecasting of an article's popularity with a remarkable 84 percent accuracy -- and it has implications not just for articles, but for tweets themselves.&quot;"

Political journalists have been known to cherrypick poll numbers to justify the chosen storyline. This isn’t a good practice.

  excerpt: "Nate Silver: &quot;I think punditry serves no purpose. I don’t care if it has a future. For journalism though, there are two ways to do it. You can go and take your traditional journalist—and many of them are fantastically good reporters, very good writers, certainly The New York Times—and try to train them more in some math and probability and statistics. Or you can hire people who come from that background, where maybe now some papers are going to hire economics majors and math majors, fields that you wouldn’t typically enter if you want to go into journalism. But I would think—I guess I would predict—you’ll see more data-driven analysts or reporters. I think at some places, there are questions about where do these journalists fit in and what do you call them? Because the term reporter is now in context, but what is it, right? The New York Times, by hiring me, took a step to do that. The Washington Post has done that with Ezra Klein, but the Times, some of the best journalists are those who make their interactive graphics. And they really do consider themselves journalists, in terms of, “We’re trying to present complex information in a way that helps elucidate the truth to people.”"

  excerpt: "&quot;A newspaper based in White Plains that drew nationwide anger after publishing the names and addresses of handgun permit holders last month is being guarded by armed security personnel at two of its offices, the publisher said Wednesday. ... Despite the anger at the newspaper’s employees — some have had their addresses mapped by bloggers in retaliation — Ms. Hasson said the newspaper would continue to seek permit information for Putnam County.  But officials there, including the county clerk and a state senator, have said they intend to block the release of permit information.&quot;"

  excerpt: "Jack Shafer: &quot;Exactly how publishing public-record data constitutes privacy invasion is a topic worthy of a Poynter Institute seminar. By its very definition, the public record is not private. Under New York state law, the information the Journal News obtained from Westchester and Rockland county authorities can be obtained by anybody who asks for it. And even though it will deflate the sails of the boycotters, their protest is futile. No law prevents individuals from making the same pistol permit request from the counties and posting their own maps if Gannett and the Journal News surrender and delete theirs. I’d wager that somebody has already scraped the data from the Journal News site and will repost it if the paper goes wobbly.&quot;"

  excerpt: "Erik Wemple: &quot;James Grimaldi, an investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal, believes that the records should open to the public, which has a right to know about permit holders. Not that the Journal News piece offers an argument for why: 'Really, it is a data dump with little analysis,' notes Grimaldi. 'They should have looked to see what the patterns are. Any criminals who got guns and shouldn't have them? School teachers? Preachers? I’d run the list against other databases — get creative. Vs. other licenses? School bus drivers? Taxi drivers? Grocers? Seems an opportunity lost.'&quot;"
