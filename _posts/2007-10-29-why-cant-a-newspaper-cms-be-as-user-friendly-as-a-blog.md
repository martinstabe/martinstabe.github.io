The much-anticipated Web 2.0 regional news portal in Germany, *[Der Westen][1],* [has gone live][2].

The front end — full of [geotagging][3] and [social networking][4] goodness is very nice indeed, but what&#8217;s been done under the bonnet that seems to be equally important. The backend of the custom-built CMS, apparently, is very user-friendly — which is important because over 800 print journalists have had to be trained to use it.

[Blogger-turned-regional-newspaper-executive][5] [Katarina Borchert][6], who has lead the project for the WAZ group, is on the cover of German journalism mag *[Medium][7]* this month, and has some extremely wise words in the interview: 

> *Ich komme ja aus der Blogwelt und habe much gefragt, warum Redaktionssysteme von Zeitungen im Vergleich zu denen für Blogs so kompliziert sein müssen.*

My translation:

> Coming from the world of blogs, I asked myself why newspapers&#8217; content management systems have to be so complicated compared to blogs&#8217;.

Why indeed. I&#8217;ve asked myself the same thing a few times over the last few months.
