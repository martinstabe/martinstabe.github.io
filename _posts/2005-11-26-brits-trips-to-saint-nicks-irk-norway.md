British tourists&rsquo;s flying to Lappland to visit Santa for Christmas are causing the [traditional annual headache for air traffic controllers in Norway][1], *Der Spiegel* reports.

On the last two Saturdays before Christmas alone, 64 flights are scheduled to fly between Britain and northern Finnland. These flights all crowd over southern Norway, prompting the Norwegean civil aviation authority to add two additional air traffic contollers to each shift.

According to the Associated Press[, 600,000 people visit Rovaniemi, Finland, each year][2] with about 250 charter flights to the village in December alone.
