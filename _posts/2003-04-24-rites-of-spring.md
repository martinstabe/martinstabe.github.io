Well, it&#8217;s late April, and that can mean only one thing; the usual baseball narrative is being rehearsed in the Big Apple: 

  * The New York Yankees are 17-3, their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/sports/baseball/24yanks.html" target="_top">best record after 20 games, ever</a>, and in first place in the American League East. Their starting pitchers are 16-0, and **Roger Clemens** is closing in on 300 career victories.
  * By contrast, the New York Mets are 9-12, last in the National League East, and have just lost both **David Cone** and **Jeremy Burnitz** to <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0422/1543035.html" target="_top">injuries</a>.

Sigh. 

I guess that&#8217;s karma for being a fair-weather fan when I was seven years old in 1986.
