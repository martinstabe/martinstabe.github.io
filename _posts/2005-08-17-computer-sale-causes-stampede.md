There was a [stampede][1] in Richmond, Virgina, as thousands of people rushed to a sale offering used Apple iBook computers for $50 each. Within seconds of the sale opeing at 7 am, there were &ldquo;several minor injuries&rdquo;, according to the *Richmond Times-Dispatch.*

The four-year old Apple notebooks had become available after the county school system switched to another supplier.
