This [AP report][1] says it all:  


> The [CBS News-New York Times poll released Monday] found Bush with a slight lead overall, 46 percent to 43 percent &#8211; roughly the same difference as the poll&#8217;s margin of error. Two weeks ago in this poll, Kerry was at 47 percent and Bush was at 46 percent. 
> 
> When independent Ralph Nader is added to the mix, Bush has a clear lead over Kerry, 46 percent to 38 percent, with Nader at 7 percent, according to the survey released Monday.

In other words, Ralph Nader is objectively pro-Republican. 

OK, not really. 

Seriously, that seven percent deserves a voice, and it&#8217;s a disgrace that the American winner-take-all electoral system (like so many others in the world) does not allow this to happen. But the lesson of history is that successful insurgent third parties in first-past-the-post systems operate from a strong geographical base where their numbers are concenstrated enough to displace one of the old parties. If Nader is serious about changing American politics, he should try to consolidate a third party in one or two states, eventually pushing for a governorship and some congressional seats. If he&#8217;s less patient and wants to change the direction of the Democrats within the current two-party system, he should contest Democratic Primaries. The Howard Dean phenomenon showed that it would have a realistic shot. Just running for President as a spoiler candidate will do nothing to change the system that Nader is right to rail against. In other words, it&#8217;s an act of hypocritical political vanity rather than a rational political tactic. Go home Ralph. Please.
