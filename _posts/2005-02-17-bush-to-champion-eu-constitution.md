Via *[Eursoc][1],* I see the *Times* is reporting that **George W. Bush** may make a speech in favour of the EU Consititution: 

> Conservative MEPs were told by Washington that one of Mr Bush&rsquo;s speeches next week will offer support to the constitution in order to help to win referendums in the three most eurosceptic countries &mdash; Britain, Poland and the Czech Republic. &ldquo;What can Bush do for his British friend? It is a clever way of rewarding him, giving him what he wants, which is the ability to win the referendum.&rdquo; **Daniel Hannan**, a Tory MEP, said.
> 
> **Condoleezza Rice**, the US Secretary of State, signalled support for the constitution during her visit to Europe last week, declaring that it was a very good development.‚Äù

Bush isn&rsquo;t exactly the most popular guy in Europe, so this may not necessarily be a huge boon for Constitution supporters. But it&rsquo;s certainly good news in terms of transatlantic relations.
