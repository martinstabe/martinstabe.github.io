Blogging here has been light in the past week because I&rsquo;ve been extraordinarily busy helping launch *Metrovox.co.uk,* a web site produced by students on the postgraduate [international journalism course at City University][1] in London. 

I designed the site and the underlying database and content management application, and have spent much of the past week dealing with the many inevitable gremlins we discovered in its first week of operation. I&rsquo;m bracing myself for another week of 12-hour days.

In addition to material produced by its own staff, the web site is publishing stories produced by other students for two newspapers, the midmarket *London Planet* and the broadsheet *London Globe.* This gives us a [large talent pool][2] to draw on. Here are some highlights to keep you busy while this blog is on semi-hiatus:

  * *Globe* editor **Gill Murdoch** looks at how [post-traumatic stress disorder affects Northern Ireland paramilitaries][3] and the difficulty they have getting treatment.
  * **Spencer Anderson** about how [construction work for the 2008 Beijing Olympics has left thousands of people homeless][4].
  * The extremely over-qualified editor-in-chief of *Metrovox,* **Ali Amar** (who also runs Morocco&rsquo;s *[Le Journal Hebdomadaire][5]),* snooped around the allegedly reformed Finsbury Park Mosque &mdash; and had a [run-in with the police][6] for his trouble. The Finsbury Park story hasn&rsquo;t been published yet, but earlier in the week, Amar wrote a piece about [Kuwaiti suffragettes][7].
  * **Lucie Tvaruzkova** interviews [Chelsea goalkeeper **Petr Cech**][8].
  * **Ruth Hetherington** conducts interviews with holders of odd jobs in London, including a 23-year-old Brazillian who [holds a sign on Oxford Street, sometimes for nine hours on end][9].
  * Indians around the world are outraged by the Indian government&rsquo;s decision that the country&rsquo;s first Formula 1 driver [can&rsquo;t display a design based on the Indian flag on his helmet][10], writes **Rashi Khilnani**.

Rashi also reviewed the [Afghan Kitchen restaurant][11] in Islington, where you really should go to eat. The pumpkin is amazing.
