Yesterday&rsquo;s *New York Times Magazine* had a [excruciatingly-long profile of **Robert Kilroy-Silk**][1]. It also includes an unusually pan-European introduction to Euroskepticism and its relationship to the transatlantic relationship.

On a related note, *The Times* notes trade commissioner and former Blairite spin-doctor **Peter Mandelson** has been [appointed to the Commission&rsquo;s communications committee][2].

> &#8230;The committee, which will meet every six to eight weeks, is chaired by the Swedish commissioner and senior vice- president of the Commission, **Margot Wallstr&ouml;m**. The committee&rsquo;s mandate is to coordinate the announcement of all European Union policies to ensure &ldquo;effective communication&rdquo;, and to develop and monitor &ldquo;the new communication strategy of the European Commission&rdquo;.
> 
> The communications committee was set up by Senhor **[Jose Manuel] Barroso** after he made &ldquo;reconnecting&rdquo; the EU with the public one of his main priorities, in order to overcome the dilemma of legitimacy that the union is facing with many voters.
> 
> A spokesman for Ms Wallstr&ouml;m said: &ldquo;The main reason Mr Mandelson is on the committee is that he has vast experience of political communication.&rdquo;
