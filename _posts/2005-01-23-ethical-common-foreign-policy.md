*Lose the Delusion* notes that the EU ready to lift its ban on [arms sales to China][1].

The [United States][2], [Japan][3], and of course [Taiwan][4] are not happy about this decision. In Britain, which switched sides to support France and Germany in this decision, [the Liberal Democrats are criticising the Government&rsquo;s decision][5]. Human Rights Watch is [not happy][6]. They all have valid points.

While the [Chinese argument][7] that it is not appropriate to continue classing them with Myanmar and Zimbabwe is not without merit, arms sales to a non-democratic government should make Europeans uneasy. The fact that there will &ldquo;stringent rules&rdquo; in place and that [Israel is also doing it][8] doesn&#8217;t make any more palitable a policy. [Less than a year ago][9], the EU refused to lift this ban because of continued concerns about [human rights in China][10].

We certainly shouldn&rsquo;t get excited about this because of its signalling of a strengthening of common foreign policy in the EU. If EU policies aren&rsquo;t better than the nation states&rsquo;, they are no more worthy of our praise.
