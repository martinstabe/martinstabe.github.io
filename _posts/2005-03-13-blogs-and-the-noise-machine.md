American political [blogging is being incorporated into the traditional partisan propaganda machines][1], **Garance Franke-Ruta** argues in the *American Prospect:*

> Along has come a new group of bloggers who aren&rsquo;t mere &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; at all. On the left side, some of these became deeply enmeshed with political parties, &ldquo;527s,&rdquo; and campaign advocacy groups &mdash; and are now a new generation of no-holds-barred partisans and major party fund-raisers, the liberal equivalent of **George W. Bush**&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pioneers.&rdquo; On the right, a number of these bloggers were already political operatives or worked at long-standing movement institutions before taking up residence online. They are, at best, the intellectual heirs of **L. Brent Bozell** of the Media Research Center and **Reed Irvine**, who founded the ultraconservative, media-hounding nonprofit organization Accuracy In Media (AIM) in 1969 as part of the first generation of post–**Barry Goldwater** right-wing institutions. At worst, they&rsquo;re the protégés of conservative fund-raiser **Richard Viguerie** and dirty-tricks master **Morton Blackwell**, who has tutored conservative activists since 1965, most recently mocking **John Kerry** at the Republican national convention by distributing Band-Aids with purple hearts on them.

The role of the traditional conservative and liberal noise machines in the downfall of **Eason Jordan** and **Jeff Gannon** must not be overlooked, Franke-Ruta argues. For those interested in understanding the role of blogs in political communications, this is an important article to read.
