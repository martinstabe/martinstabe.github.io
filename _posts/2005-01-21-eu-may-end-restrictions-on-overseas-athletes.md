Restictions on the number of non-EU players allowed to play in European professional sports leagues may be on the way out.

Deutsche Welle is [reporting][1] that following a challenge by **Igor Simutenkov**, a Russian footballer playing for the Spanish side Deportivo Tenerife, a European Court of Justice may soon be made:

> His argument was based on a partnership agreement between Russia and the EU. The EU&rsquo;s advocate-general, **Christine Stix-Hackl**, said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions.

The ECJ usually adopts the opinions of advocates-general.

This seems to extend the logic of the well-known [Bosman ruling][2], which requires that foreign-player quotas in professional sports leagues treat all EU-citizen players equally.
