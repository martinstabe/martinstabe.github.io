I wonder how much [**John Prescott**&rsquo;s moment of madness][1] in Wales contributed to the Blaenau Gwent constituency returning the biggest swing against Labour.

To be fair, probably not much. **Peter Law**, the rebel Labour candidate who won 58.17 per cent of the vote there was standing against his party to [protest against all-women shortlists][2].
