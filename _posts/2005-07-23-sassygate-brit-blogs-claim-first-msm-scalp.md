The British blogosphere has claimed its [first MSM scalp][1]. 

*Eursoc* has an [excellent summary][2] of the events that lead to this, but overstates the case somewhat.

> UK bloggers may have hit on a home-grown scandal as significant as last year&rsquo;s weblog-led revelation that CBS had been duped by forged documents relating to George W. Bush&rsquo;s military record.

A 27-year-old *trainee* journalist is not **Dan Rather** and **Mary Mapes**.

Still, **Scott Burgess** of the *Daily Ablution* deserves credit for noticing that *Guardian* trainee **Dilpazier Aslam** had prior to his employment with the *Guardian,* [written an article calling for a Caliphate][3] and soon followed up by alleging that Aslam had been, until last June at least, [a member of Hizb Ut Tahrir][4], the story has quickly grown.

Despite the lowly target, the story has had the hallmarks of an American-style blogswarm. After being [amplified][5] by the major British conservative and liberationist blogs, it had its essential mainstreaming moment when the story was [picked up by a mainstream news outlet][6], in this case, the *Independent on Sunday.*

Oh yeah: The article that provoked all this probing into Aslam&rsquo;s background has been [re-printed][7] in the *Los Angeles Times.* I wonder if they&rsquo;ll take noteof his fate. I&rsquo;m sure the bloggers will insist that they do.

**Update (23/7 1419 BST):** The right-wing American blogger **Michelle Malkin** [links][8] to my comment about the *LA Times* and provides a link to their ombudsman. [Oops][9].

The *Guardian&rsquo;s* media secton now [has a report][10], with lots of quotes from the blogosphere:

> Rightwing bloggers from the US, where the *Guardian* has a large online following, were behind the targeting last week of a trainee *Guardian* journalist who wrote a comment piece which they did not care for about the London bombings.
> 
> The story is a demonstration of the way the &lsquo;blogosphere&rsquo; can be used to mount obsessively personalised attacks at high speed.
> 
> Within hours, Dilpazier Aslam was being accused on the internet of &ldquo;violence&rdquo; and belonging to a &ldquo;terrorist organisation&rdquo; &mdash; both completely untrue charges.
> 
> One blogger appealed for &ldquo;some loyal Briton to saw off your head and ship it to me&rdquo;. Another accused Aslam of being guilty of &ldquo;accessory before the fact to murder.&rdquo;
> 
> These ravings were posted alongside more legitimate questions as to whether a newspaper should employ a reporter who belongs to a controversial political group linked to the promotion of anti-semitic views.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> In the *Independent on Sunday*, **Shiv Malik**, also briefly a *Guardian* intern, accused the hapless Aslam of mounting &ldquo;a sting by Hizb ut-Tahrir to infiltrate the mainstream media&rdquo;.
> 
> And in the tabloid *Sun,* their attack-dog columnist, **Richard Littlejohn**, took the opportunity to claim: &ldquo;A *Guardian* journalist has been unmasked as an Islamist extremist&rdquo;.
> 
> Many bloggers repeated Malik&rsquo;s untrue assertion &mdash; made in *the Independent on Sunday* &mdash; that the *Guardian* was &ldquo;refusing to sack&rdquo; Aslam.
> 
> The episode was a striking illustration of the way that blogs and bloggers can heat up the temperature and seek to settle scores &mdash; as well as raise legitimate concerns about journalism and transparency &mdash; when something awful happens in the streets of London.

Defensive &mdash; but fair. Anyone following this story on the blogoshere would have had to wade through a lot of misinformation to get to the essential and relevant issues. A lot of chaff needs to be ignored to get to the blogosphere&rsquo;s wheat.

What does it all mean? Well, I&rsquo;ll have to revise my theory of the [weakness of British blogging a bit][11]. Perhaps Britain&rsquo;s tradition of a partisan press that makes no claim to be &ldquo;objective&rdquo; does not rule out this sort of thing. The *Independent* was all too eager to skewer its rival in the market for progressive readers. The British-based blogs (one run by an American expat) that were central to this story also had plenty of support from conservative bloggers in the United States.
