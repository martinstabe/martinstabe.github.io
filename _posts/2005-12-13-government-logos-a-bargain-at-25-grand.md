The Department of Constitutional Affairs&rsquo; new logo cost [&pound;25,000 to design][1], Constitutional Affairs minister **Harriet Harman** revealed last Thursday.

The re-branded Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s Department also spent &pound;12,842 on a logo for the Freedom of Information Act. Both masterpieces of graphic design can be seen [here][2].

Remember the short-lived post-election rebranding of the DTI as the &ldquo;Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry&rdquo;? Total cost included [&pound;30,000 on the re-branding proposal][3] and [&pound;15,400 on the u-turn][4] &mdash; after [&pound;560,000 had been spent since 2002][3] on &ldquo;rationalising&rdquo; various imagery around a single DTI logo.

These are all segments of one overarching organisation &mdash; the British state. Why they need a new corporate identity every time there is a tinkering with the cogs of the state apparatus or a new law passed is beyond me. Just [another reason for a unified branding scheme for government][5].
