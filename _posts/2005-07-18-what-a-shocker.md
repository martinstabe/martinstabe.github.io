The Netherlands have [defended their European baseball championship][1], beating Italy 15-0 in the final in Prague. The Dutch are the dominant in Europe, having now won [won 19 of the 29 championships since 1954][2]. Italy is Europe&rsquo;s second power, having won eight.

Spain and Germany finished third and fourth, and have therefore qualified for the 2007 World Cup.

Great Britain finished seventh. The team must be on a bit of a downer since their hopes host nation qualification for the 2012 Olympics were scuppered by the [IOC chosing not to include baseball in the programme for the London games][3].

Another interesting outcome was the ninth-place finish of Greece. It was their first major tournament since the country cobbled together its Olympic baseball teams from north Americans hastily given Greek passports. In the [2003 European Championships][4], Greece was represented for the first time ever, and the team of professional ringers went all the way to the final before being stopped by &mdash; who else &mdash; the Dutch.

This concludes my periodic unhealthy obsession with a European minority sport &mdash; at least until the [2005 World Cup][5] begins in Amsterdam in September.
