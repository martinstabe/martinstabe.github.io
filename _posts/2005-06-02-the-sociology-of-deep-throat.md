*Pub Sociology* links to the [1992 *Atlantic* article][1] that first named **Mark Felt** as Deep Throat, and points out that the [sociological significance of the Deep Throat saga][2], particularly the way it illustrates bureaucratic politics:

> &#8230; the story of Deep Throat is also interesting from a sociological perspective. Mark Felt&rsquo;s motivations to aid the Watergate investigation were more than just personal. Felt, along with other senior FBI administrators, were caught in a battle with Nixon&rsquo;s White House over institutional control. Deep Throat was a reflection of the bureaucratic politics of the era &mdash; the pitting of an agency that prided itself for its autonomy against a patrimonial administration that trusted no one and wanted to usurp whatever bureaucratic control over federal agencies they could.
