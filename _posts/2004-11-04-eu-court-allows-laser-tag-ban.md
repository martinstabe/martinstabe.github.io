The Eurosceptic British press is unlikely to pounce on the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s [decision][1] last month that EU law does not prevent national governments from [banning &#8220;laser tag&#8221;][2]-style games which &#8220;simulate homocide&#8221;.

A logical consequence of this decision is that nothing would prevent a national government from banning, say, paintball, or supersoakers. It wouldn&#8217;t take much creative distortion to transform that into a tabloid headline screaming &#8220;EU bans squirt guns!&#8221; 

Still, this sort of story wouldn&#8217;t fit the Eurosceptic agenda. All the European Court has ruled is that this matter doesn&#8217;t concern EU law and therefore falls under national sovereignty. This just doesn&#8217;t fit the Euromyth narrative, in which &#8220;Brussels&#8221; is the fount of all petty, politically-correct bureaucratic meddling and EU law is ever-expanding at the expense of national judicial sovereignty. But if anybody is guilty of illiberal regulation in this instance, it is a district council in Germany, not any institution of the European Union. And the EU top tribunal has ruled that there&#8217;s nothing Brussels can do to stop it.
