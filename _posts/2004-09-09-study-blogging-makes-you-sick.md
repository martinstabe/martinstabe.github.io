Just kidding. But a study reported by the *New Scientist* claims that [keeping a diary may be bad for your health][1]. The British researchers found that &#8220;diarists were more likely than non-diarists to suffer from headaches, sleeplessness, digestive problems and social awkwardness.&#8221; Might this also apply to bloggers?

Another (totally unrelated) *New Scientist* gem this week suggests that scientists suspect, like geek comic-strip favourite *Dilbert*, that many [sub-criminal psychopaths][2] end up in corporate managerial positions.
