[The announcement has finally been made][1]: [Wilmington Media][2] is the new owner of Press Gazette.

Wilmington editorial director Tony Loynes, a former *Press Gazette* editor, is the new editor-in-chief. He has been busy calling the former staff to persuade them to rejoin the magazine. Rob McGibbon has written a post about [his reaction to getting the call][3].

I went down to the Fleet Street newsroom yesterday morning to commission a post for the */discuss Journalism* forum (which is temporarily redirecting to [the journalism page of AOL&#8217;s */discuss* site][4]). I also filed my copy for the magazine version of &#8220;Fleet Street 2.0&#8243;, which is based on posts written for the column&#8217;s home-in-exile on this blog.

Once normal online service resumes at *Press Gazette,* the *Fleet Street 2.0* blog will probably resume [over there][5], too.
