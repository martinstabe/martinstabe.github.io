**<a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/" target="_top">Atrios</a>** has several interesting stories today: 

  * The Homeland Security department plans to &#8220;[detain Iraqi sympathizers][1].&#8221;
  * German and French offices at the EU have been <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/19/world/main544558.shtml" target="_top">bugged</a>. Sound familiar? 
  * Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/iraq-sources-networks.html" target="_top">states the obvious</a> about the media coverage of the impending war.

TomPaine.com <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/op_ads/opad.cfm/ID/7434" target="_top">reminds us</a> that **Osama bin Laden** wants the U.S. to invade Iraq. And since this would all be incredibly funny if it weren&#8217;t serious, check out the <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/store.aspx?s=warposter.0" target="_top">remixed propaganda</a> posters.

To redress the balance of recent weeks, some bias in the opposite direction, (via [Breaching the Web][2]): the French embassy&#8217;s rose-tinted account of the <a href="http://www.info-france-usa.org/franceus/" target="_top">history of Franco-American relations</a>. 

In* Slate, *the answer to one piece of trivia that has troubled me for years: why American troopers&#8217; shoulder patches show the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2080338" target="_top">American flag backwards</a>. The reason is just what I presumed. Bring on the pub quiz.
