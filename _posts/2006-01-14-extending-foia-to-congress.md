A number of American A-list [bloggers are calling for the coverage of the US Freedom of Information Act to be extended][1] so that it Congress itself is subject to citizens&rsquo; requests for information.

Of course that&#8217;s a good idea. Holding Parliamentarians to account has even worked here in traditionally secretive Britain: The biggest political scalp collected by journalists in the first year of FOIA in Britain was a [member of the Scottish Parliament caught fiddling his taxi expenses][2]. The UK Parliament, though covered by FOIA, has been [less forthcoming][3].
