Some bereaved bloggers are writing premature poetry for our dear departed magazine.

Here&#8217;s a taster of PT Stodd&#8217;s [fantastic verse][1]:

> *So farewell then to the Press Gazette*  
> *The hacks’ neglected organ.*  
> *You seemed to chug along quite well*  
> *in the years before Piers Morgan.*

The big news, though — [first sniffed by Paul Linford][2] earlier this week despite [inadvertent misinformation][3] from me — is that *Press Gazette* [may be showing signs of coming back to life][4].

As he does far too frequently, Stephen Brook at *MediaGuardian* [has the story][5].
