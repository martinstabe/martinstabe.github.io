Commenting on my [post about computer-assisted reporting][1] yesterday, [Danny Sanchez][2] [suggests][3] that anyone interested in learning more about CAR should join the [listserve][4] run by the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting in the United States.

That&#8217;s a very good piece of advice. I have learned a lot just by lurking on that list.

Following an [excellent investigative reporting conference][5] last summer, [Heather Brooke][6] and I have talked about setting up an organisation similar to NICAR to promote the development of computer-assisted reporting in Britain.

It hasn&#8217;t really got beyond the vague chatter stage, but if you&#8217;re a UK-based journalist interested in this, please join our [&#8220;BICAR&#8221; listserve][7] as well.
