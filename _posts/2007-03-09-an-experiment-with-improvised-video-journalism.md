Attempting to blog an event &#8220;as live&#8221; by typing furiously during a speaker&#8217;s presentation is extremely difficult. I&#8217;ve done it many times, and the results are rarely satisfactory. The result is usually a long, rambling post that does the reader no service in terms of selecting the good bits.

Faced with another marathon session of liveblogging at the Online Publishers Association conference this morning, I decided, on a whim, to try to report the event using what I thought might be a more appropriate medium — video.

So when Forbes.com chief executive James Spanfeller got up to speak, I used the only video camera available to me — the iSight webcam built into my MacBook — to record his speech from the front row.

People must have thought I was a bit odd for sitting in the front row with my laptop pointing *away* from me thoughout the speech. Unfortunately, this strange camera technique also meant that I couldn&#8217;t see what I was doing. I just had to hope Spanfeller was in the picture.

Nevertheless, the video and audio quality was remarkably good given that both the camera and microphone are [tiny pinholes at the top of my laptop&#8217;s screen][1]. 

Still, the outcome you see above is not something I&#8217;d want to inflict on viewers using the glorious 600-pixel-wide space available for pictures or video on [the shiny new blog over at *Press Gazette.*][2] 

The video was was marred by the fact that the camera is attached to the relatively flimsy top of a laptop screen, which shoock slightly with every minor vibration on the table. The incessant clickityclack you hear on the on the soundtrack is due to someone ([cough][3]) sitting nearby who was assaulting her laptop&#8217;s keyboard as if it were a worn out manual typewriter.

Problem number two: [Video takes a long time][4] to get online compared to text and still photography. By the time I had run my (very) rough video through iMovie to edit it down to the quote I wanted to highlight, exported it, uploaded it to YouTube, and wrote a post to introduce it, I discovered that Oliver Luft at Journalism.co.uk had already [reported the story very effectively][5] using the conventional text-only approach.

Many lessons learned. Time to invest in a decent camera, tripod and microphone. Don&#8217;t use video when speed is of the essence.
