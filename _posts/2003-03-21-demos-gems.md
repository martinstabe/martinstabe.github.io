The think tank Demos has an excellent blog called The Greenhouse. They don&#8217;t post much, but what they post has been very intersting. This week, they seem to have covered all my pet topics: the war, surveillance, and political communication: 

  * A recently declassified American report into the use of <a href="http://www.demosgreenhouse.co.uk/archives/000079.html" target="_top">tactical nuclear weapons</a> in Vietnam, written in 1967, mentioned the prospect of nuclear terrorism
  * An article in a magazine published at MIT says that &#8220;<a href="http://www.demosgreenhouse.co.uk/archives/000078.html" target="_top">surveillance</a> will become so ubiquitous, networked, and searchable that unmonitored public space will effectively cease to exist.&#8221;
  * Media Workers Against War sponsored an event about the attempts to <a href="http://www.demosgreenhouse.co.uk/archives/000077.html" target="_top">manage public opinion</a> and the possibilities of post-spin government.
