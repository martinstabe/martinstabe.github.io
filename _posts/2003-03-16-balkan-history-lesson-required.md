Since the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister **Zoran Djindjic,** the puditocracy and blogosphere has not been able to resist drawing analogies between present world events and the June 1914 assassination &#8212; in Sarajevo, not Belgrade &#8212; of Austrian archduke **Franz Ferdinand** that sparked the First World War. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/opinion/16FRIE.html" target="_top">latest perpetrator</a> of this weak analogy is none other than **Thomas Friedman** of the *New York Times.* 

**Matthew Yglesias **rightly** **<a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002617.html#002617" target="_top">insisted</a> on some historical and geographical accuracy a couple of days ago. <a href="http://www.ku.edu/~kansite/ww_one/comment/sarajevo.html" target="_top">This</a> might be a good place to start a refresher of your high school history lessons.
