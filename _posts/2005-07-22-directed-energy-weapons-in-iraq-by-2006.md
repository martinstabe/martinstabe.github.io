**David Hambling**, writing in the *New Scientist* has [more information][1] about the microwave weapons story I&rsquo;ve been watching (AP report [here][2] and pictures [here][3]).

> The [Active Denial System] fires a 95-gigahertz microwave beam, which is supposed to heat skin and to cause pain but no physical damage &#8230; Little information about its effects has been released, but details of tests in 2003 and 2004 were revealed after Edward Hammond, director of the US [Sunshine Project][4] &mdash; an organisation campaigning against the use of biological and non-lethal weapons &mdash; requested them under the Freedom of Information Act.

> A vehicle-mounted version of ADS called Sheriff could be in service in Iraq in 2006 according to the Department of Defense, and it is also being evaluated by the US Department of Energy for use in defending nuclear facilities. The US marines and police are both working on portable versions, and the US air force is building a system for controlling riots from the air.
