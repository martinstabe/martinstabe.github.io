The *San Francisco Chronicle* [watches **Seymour Hersh** dig through his briefcase][1]:

> But wait, he&rsquo;s found another treasure. &ldquo;I just found something great, you want to see something great?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s clutching a cache of documents, recently procured in London &mdash; internal memos from March 2002 warning British Prime Minister **Tony Blair** against invading Iraq. Seeds of a forthcoming Hersh investigation? &ldquo;Shut off that tape recorder.&rdquo;

Watch this space. [[ADDED 8.1.2006][2]]
