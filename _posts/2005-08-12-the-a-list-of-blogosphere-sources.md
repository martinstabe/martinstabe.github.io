**Dave Sifry** has a Technorati chart of the [most-linked-to web sites in the blogosphere][1]. 

Most of them are mainstream news sites, with just 11 blogs in the top 35. There&rsquo;s a significant British media contingent in the top 35: the BBC, *Guardian, Times* and *Economist* are all represented.
