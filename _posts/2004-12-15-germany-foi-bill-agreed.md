The ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition in Germany is forging ahead with its [freedom of information bill][1], despite objections from the Government.

Two earlier versions of the bill, sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior, were rejected by legislators because the exemptions they envisaged &mdash; including blanket exemption of the Ministry of Defense &mdash; would have been too broad.
