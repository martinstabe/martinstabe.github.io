The *Independent* takes careful aim at its foot&#8230; 

<a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,942130,00.html" target="_top">And fires:</a>  


> Selected areas of Independent.co.uk, including opinion pieces, articles by celebrated Middle East correspondent **Robert Fisk**, the news and sport archive and the cryptic crosswords, will carry a charge from this week. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> While page impressions &#8211; the number of individual pages opened by a user &#8211; will inevitably decline with the introduction of fees, the paper expects most users to stay. 
> 
> Users have four options: paying £1 to access one item for 24 hours, £5 for a monthly subscription to a section, £30 for an annual subscription to a section and £60 for an annual subscription to all sections. </blockquote> 
> 
> Hang on. One pound for *one article?* The dead-tree edition costs 55 pence for the whole friggin&#8217; paper! OK, maybe this makes business sense. Who knows. But it will certainly guarantee that my blog will not be quoting Fisk (nor the increasingly-crazy **Johann Hari**) much any more. I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t be alone. It strikes me as rather counterproductive to discourage access to the most lucrative parts of one&#8217;s web site. Expect a spectacular u-turn as the subscription fee income doesn&#8217;t make up for the loss in banner-ad sales.
