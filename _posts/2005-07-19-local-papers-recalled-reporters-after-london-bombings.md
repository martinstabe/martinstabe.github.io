The Dart Center for Journalism & Trauma has produced an excellent [roundup and assessment of the coverage][1] of the London bombings and has a [list of resources][2] for reporters covering events like the London bombings. Given the attention (and [criticism][3]) the &ldquo;citizen paparazzi&rdquo; have been getting on this story, perhaps bloggers and owners of camera-phones should read this, too.

Historically, many news organisations were criticised for indifference to reporters&rsquo; well-being in hostile environements, traumatic situations, or potentially-dangerous stories. But there has also been at least one over-reaction in the opposite direction, as **Alyson Fixter** [reports][4] for the *Press Gazette:*

> Journalists at more than 60 weekly newspapers were banned from going out to report on the London bombings last Thursday amid fears for their safety &mdash; even though some were as far away as Kent and Buckinghamshire.
> 
> Staff at Trinity Mirror Southern titles &mdash; including the *South London Press, The Wharf,* the *Croydon Advertiser,* the *Reading Chronicle* and even the *Whitstable & Herne Bay Times* series &mdash; received an order to come back to the office or go straight home on Thursday afternoon.
> 
> A member of staff who contacted *Press Gazette* said the decision &ldquo;went down like a lead balloon&rdquo; in newsrooms as even journalists who were on jobs unrelated to the bombing, miles from London, were recalled.
