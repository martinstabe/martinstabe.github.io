The *Financial Times* today reported that English Heritage is [getting concerned][1] about the [Clone Town][2] phenomenon: that all English towns and cities increasingly look the same because of the proliferation of the big high street retailers.

Of course, they are less concerned with the economic impact of retail consolidation than the fact that it all the big-brand signs are so un-pretty. Sigh.

(For an American view, see **Matt Yglesias**&rsquo; post and comments on [chain-ification][3].)
