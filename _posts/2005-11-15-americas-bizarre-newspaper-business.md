**Matthew Yglesias** notes the [bizarre nature of the American newspaper business][1], which is organised as a series of regional monopolies, and one of commenters [ponders][2] why the British model of national newspapers hasn&rsquo;t caught on in the United States.

The geographical size of the United States is a big part of it. Until quite recently, it was technologically impossible to print and distribute a truly national newspaper on a continental scale. Britain is simply a much smaller, more densly-populated place. 

What&rsquo;s most interesting about all this is that segmented monopolies have consequences for the content of newspapers. If you are a regional monopoly, you have to appeal to everyone in a community, you will do your best not to be overtly partisan. In Britain, where there are no regional monopolies, The only way to segment the market is along ideological lines. 

A very different ideal of journalism emerges as a result. With geography collapsing as a barrier, is it any wonder the ideal of objectivity in American journalism is increasingly coming under attack as an anchronism?

(I also happen to think that this explains the [relative weakness of the British blogosphere][3], which doesn&rsquo;t have to make this critique of its mainstream press.)
