Nothing infuriates me more than those who agree with me that the coming war in Iraq is unjustified, but can only resort to worn platitudes and half-baked theories in arguing against it. It makes us doves look bad. None is worse than the refrain that &#8220;it&#8217;s all about oil.&#8221; OK, but how exactly? **<a href="http://www.brendanoneill.net/" target="_top">Brendan O&#8217;Neill</a>** takes on this &#8220;<a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000006DCBB.htm" target="_top">crude argument</a>&#8221; in *Spiked.* No doubt, oil obviously is an issue at some level; but a little precision is called for. **Michael Kinsley** is my sort of skeptical dove. As <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2079744/" target="_top">Kinsley writes in <i>Slate</i></a>*, *&#8220;it is hard to dismiss the official reasons for this war as disingenuous without some theory about what the ulterior motive or unspoken war aim might be.&#8221; His theory of ulterior motives is no stronger than the rest, but his thinking is a good start. The <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2079611" target="_top">counter-arguments</a> are good, too.
