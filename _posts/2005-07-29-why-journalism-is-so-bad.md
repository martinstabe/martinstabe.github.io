Must read: **Chris Dillow** of *Stumbling and Mumbling* (and *Investors Chronicle)* comes up with a compelling set of [reasons why is journalism so bad][1]:

&ldquoThe problem with the dead tree industry lies in the culture of journalism itself, rather than in the corruption of the profit motive,&rdquo; he writes. Specifically, the professional weaknesses he identifies are lack of domain expertise among correspondents, status obsession, the bias toward anecdote-driven narratives, and epidemic cognitive biases due to poor training as the major problems with jounralists&rsquo; professional culture.
