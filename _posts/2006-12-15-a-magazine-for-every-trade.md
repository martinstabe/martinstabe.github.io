Discovered via the referrer logs to a recent post about the [BBC&#8217;s &#8220;prostitutes&#8221; debate][1] caused by the Suffolk serial killer story: *[$pread Magazine][2]. *Tagline: &#8220;Illuminating the Sex Industry.&#8221;

On its site I learned that Sunday is The International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers.
