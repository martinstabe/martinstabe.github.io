There&rsquo;s no indication that the London bombings were set off by some sort of remote signal. There is no cell phone coverage in most of the London underground.

I know there are some spots on the Circle Line (particularly in the shallow tunnels around Baker Street) where a signal occasionally penetrates, but because of the depth of the tunnels involved, particularly in the Piccadilly Line bomb, timers are the more likely trigger. 

That hasn&rsquo;t stopped others from worrying about mobile phone technology as a possible enabler of terrorism.

Still, [the New York City subway has disabled mobile phone transmitters in its tunnels][1]. Federal law enforcement agencies in the United States are worried that in-flight [broadband connections on aircraft could be used to coordinate hijackings][2] and therefore want the right to snoop on such connections. 

I&#8217;m sure there will be similar worries about [in-flight mobile phone networks][3] now under development.

Somewhat off topic, another article about the potential terrorist uses of wireless gadgetry, the *IHT* also spots some interesting statistics about the [spike in texting in Britain on Thursday][4] that certainly resemble my experience:

> &#8230; about three times more text messages were sent by mobile phone to and from Britain on Thursday after the bombings than on a normal day, according to statistics from Mobile 365, a messaging interconnection company based in Chantilly, Virginia.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> Thus, while many mobile phone connections failed to get through because of the crush of calls on Thursday morning, text messages often made contact, telecommunications and law enforcement authorities said.
> 
> From 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., the hour of the bombings, international text traffic into and out of Britain rose 2.75 times over the like hour the previous day, Mobile 365 said. In the 9 a.m. hour, there were 5.6 times as many, and in the hour after 10 a.m., there were four times as many.
> 
> Text traffic stayed at least three times as high through 2 p.m., compared with the previous day, and stayed at least twice as high through 6 p.m., the company said.
