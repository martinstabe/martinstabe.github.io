I wonder if the right wing of the American media will ever wake up the fact that Canada has clearly joined France, Germany, Russia and Belgium in the &#8220;Axis of Weasel&#8221; in many other ways. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/05/27/chretien_athens030527" target="_top">According to the CBC</a>,  


> A candid Prime Minister **Jean Chr&#233;tien** told reporters on a flight to Europe Tuesday that he and U.S. President **George W. Bush** have many opposing views. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> Chr&#233;tien said his government has had a string of budget surpluses while the &#8220;right-wing&#8221; government in Washington is running up a $500-billion deficit. 
> 
> Chr&#233;tien highlighted several differences between himself and Bush. 
> 
> He said Bush opposes abortion while he favours a woman&#8217;s right to choose. 
> 
> Bush supports capital punishment and Chr&#233;tien does not. 
> 
> Chr&#233;tien supports gun control and Bush does not. 
> 
> And Chr&#233;tien acknowledged he is closer to former president **Bill Clinton**, a Democrat, than the current office holder. </blockquote>
