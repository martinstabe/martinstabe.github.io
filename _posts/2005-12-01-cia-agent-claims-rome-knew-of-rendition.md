The lawyer for one of the [22 CIA agents wanted in Italy][1] for the kidnapping of terror suspect **Abu Omar** has [claimed the Italian government knew about the &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;][2] operation.

A lawyer challenging the arrest warrant on **Robert Seldon Lady**, the former CIA station chief in Milan, said his client&rsquo;s actions had had &ldquo;explicit, or at least implicit authorisation from the Italian government.&rdquo;

> In her first appeal, Lady&rsquo;s lawyer **Daria Pesce**, claimed he was innocent or &ldquo;only following orders&rdquo; and was occupying the role of consul at the time, giving him &ldquo;diplomatic immunity&rdquo; which also covered him for &ldquo;special missions&rdquo;. However, this argument was rejected by the judge, who decreed that immunity does not cover &ldquo;serious crimes like kidnapping&rdquo;. State secrets, he argued, protect &ldquo;the security of Italian democracy&rdquo; and not &ldquo;actions carried out by foreign operatives&rdquo;.
> 
> The Italian government and intelligence service SISMI have always denied knowledge of the operation to capture **Abu Omar**. However, Lady&rsquo;s lawyer stated twice in his defence that &ldquo;Lady, in his consular role as intelligence supervisor, undoubtedly enjoyed the authorisation of the US government in agreement with the political authorities of the Italian state&rdquo; and this &ldquo;Italian approval&rdquo; was &ldquo;indispensible&rdquo; for a &ldquo;special mission sent by the United States&rdquo;.
> 
> Italy&rsquo;s *La Repubblica* newspaper speculated on Wednesday that Italian prime minister **Silvio Berlusconi** could soon find himself forced to make a difficult choice: &ldquo;Turn the whole affair into a state secret, thereby admitting that Palazzo Chigi [the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office] knew, or alternatively, hand over to the Milan prosecutor&rsquo;s office the names of those who authorised or kept quiet about the kidnapping of Abu Omar.&rdquo;

Given that EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner [**Franco Frattini** this week threatened &ldquo;serious consequences&rdquo;][3] &mdash; including suspension of voting rights in the Council of Ministers &mdash; for EU member states complicit in operating alleged &ldquo;black site&rdquo; prisons, he is likely to also take a dim view on EU governments participating in &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;. Berlusconi may have had his decision forced upon him.

The Milan judge [rejected Lady&rsquo;s claim of diplomatic immunity][4]. A [very interesting trial][5] is about to unfold.
