Finsbury Park station was closed this morning after a bomb threat.

Police cordoned off the area aroond the north London tube and train station. Bus services were suspended along Seven Sisters Road and Blackstock Road as traffic came to a complete standstill.

One police officer at the scene said a bomb threat had been phoned in.  
The area was re-opened just after 10am, but the station remains closed.
