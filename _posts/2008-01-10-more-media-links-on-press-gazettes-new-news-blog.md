As far as search-engine optimisation goes, this might not have been the best week to launch a new journalism blog called The Wire. But [we&#8217;ve done it anyway][1].

The project I&#8217;ve been working on for quite some time now, [Press Gazette&#8217;s news blog][2], is now live.

We&#8217;re sticking with the name that we decided on months ago, when the site was only in the planning stages, and we had little concern that a TV show might cause any problems for our search engine optimisation efforts.

(In case you&#8217;ve been living under a rock this week, the fifth season of the HBO police drama programme *The Wire,* [which premiered this week][3], features a key storyline about the *Baltimore Sun* newspaper. D&#8217;oh.)

Our title, of course, is meant to invoke PA much more than the Baltimore PD. In the long run, it probably won&#8217;t matter, anyway.
