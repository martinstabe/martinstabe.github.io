As Robin Hamman points out, there are [all sorts of personal connections][1] between the journalists named in *Press Gazette&#8217;s* [UK journalism blogroll feature][2] today.

Because many of the bloggers named in the piece also use the social bookmarking tool del.icio.us, it is even possible to visualise these connections using the amazing (and addictive) [Del.icio.us Network Explorer][3] social network analysis tool.

The dark nodes in the network above are people named in connection with the *Press Gazette* piece. I&#8217;m the green dot in the middle (only because I started exporling the network with my own user name), and Robin Hamman is the orange one. 

[Jem Stone][4] is the large node at the top with links to many of the others. The author of the *Press Gazette* feature, [Graham Holliday][5] is to Robin&#8217;s 10 o&#8217;clock position, and [Richard Sambrook][6] is at Robin&#8217;s 3 o&#8217;clock.

Further exploration of the network reveals some other important nodes in the network, whose involvment in the jounralism blogger community is largely centred on their del.icio.us use: *Sun* communities editor [Ilana Fox][7] and Trinity Mirror&#8217;s director of regional digital media, [David Black][8]. You should really be subscribing to their del.icio.us links&#8217; RSS feeds.

**Update:** Ditto [Alan Connor][9], [Alistair Brown][10], and [Bruce Combe][11].
