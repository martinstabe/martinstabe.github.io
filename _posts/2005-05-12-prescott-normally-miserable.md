All in [one superb BBC Online report][1]: **John Prescott** supports the silly [Bluewater ban on hoodies][2] because he was nearly the victim of a &ldquo;happy slapping&rdquo;.

Apparently the young thugs that terrorised the deputy prime minister &mdash; where is special branch when you need them? &mdash; all wore hoods. Ergo the rest of us shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to wear them, either.

And then there&rsquo;s this priceless graf:

> Some newspapers claimed Mr Prescott looked miserable when the Cabinet reshuffle was under way last week but he insisted that was his &ldquo;normal face&rdquo;.
