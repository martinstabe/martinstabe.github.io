[Priceless stuff][1] from a CNN poll:

> Forty-nine percent of 1,007 adult Americans said in phone interviews they believe Bush is a &ldquo;uniter,&rdquo; according to the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday. Another 49 percent called him a &ldquo;divider,&rdquo; and 2 percent had no opinion.
