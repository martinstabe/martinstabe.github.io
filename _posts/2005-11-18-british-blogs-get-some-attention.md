*[2005 Blogged][1]* hits the bookshops today. The **Tim Worstall**-edited tome is a retrospective of 2005 seen through the eyes of those &ldquo;rising stars of online journalism&rdquo;, the British bloggers. I haven&rsquo;t received my copy yet, but rumour has it [one of my more infamous posts][2] is in there somewhere. Since the publishers have been, um, pretty stingy on the royalties front, do me a favour and buy <s>several dozen copies</s> a copy through [my Amazon associates link][1].

Also in the news today is **[Paul Berger][3]**&rsquo;s story in the *Online Journalism Review* asking [why the British blogosphere is lagging behind][4] is American cousins. My two cents are free to read in this one.

All of this follows yesterday&rsquo;s cover story in the *Guardian&rsquo;s G2* section, profiling some of the key members of [Britain&rsquo;s new blogger commentariat][5]. The key quote in that story comes from *Samizdata&rsquo;s* **Perry de Havilland**, who understands the relationship between bloggers and journalists better than most:

> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not competing with newspapers,&rdquo; De Havilland interrupts &#8230; &ldquo;But I tell you who we are in competition with, 100% direct competition, and that&rsquo;s your op-ed writers. We don&rsquo;t have a reporter in Kandahar, and you might, it&rsquo;s true &mdash; although in time we might have a blogger in Kandahar. But for the moment, sure: if your guy in Kandahar says X blew up Y, then X blew up Y. But when your editorial guy says, &lsquo;This is what it means,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s when we say, &lsquo;Excuse me! You&rsquo;re completely wrong!&rsquo;&rdquo;

That&rsquo;s more or less how I see blogs, too. And as a consequence, I think **Oliver Kamm** draws the more logical conclusion about what this means than De Havilland:</blockquote> 

Britain&rsquo;s bloggers are divided not just by ideology, it turns out, but by their perception of their own importance: while *Samizdata* proclaims that blogs are the future, for example, **Oliver Kamm** insists they are an essentially parasitic medium, that can only exist insofar as it feasts on the output of traditional media.</blockquote> 

Bloggers are inevitably parasites on traditional news organisations&rsquo;s reporting. As an organic network of isolated commentators rather than a rationally-constructed network of correspondents, bloggers cannot replicate the systematic information-gathering function of traditional news organisations.

But bloggers can compete on some of the other functions that traditional news organisations have in the past used to add value to information: ascribing political meaning to their reporting and making subjective connections between data that are already available in the public sphere.

In the past, only well-financed news organisations with vast, well-organised cuttings libraries or (more recently) access to expensive subscription-based database tools like Lexis-Nexis could quickly research all the previously-reported information about a subject. Google has made a basic verion of this capability available to everybody.
