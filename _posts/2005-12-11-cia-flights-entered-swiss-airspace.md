Now they don&rsquo;t even need to land to raise eyebrows. The *Neue Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung* reports that &ldquo;a small jet chartered by [the CIA has flown over Switzerland 19 times since the start of 2003][1]&rdquo;.

The flights included one on 17 February 2003, the day that [**Abu Omar** was allegedly flown from Italy to Germany][2] during his &ldquo;extraordinary rendition &rdquo; to Egypt:

> The Federal Civil Aviation Office has confirmed that on February 17, 2003 a Learjet Model LJ-35, using the call sign &ldquo;SPAR 92&rdquo;, twice flew over Swiss air space &mdash; from Aviano to Ramstein and back again.
> 
> SPAR is short for Special Air Resources, a military airlift service that uses Learjets and other executive-style jets to transport senior military officers and civilian VIPs.

Meanwhile the *Malta Independent* [continues to follow][3] the comings and goings of the suspect flights in Malta:

> This week another landing in Malta has surfaced with reports and sightings evidencing the presence of a De Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter in Malta between 2 and 3 August 2005. Plane spotters capturing images of the aircraft at Malta International Airport remark on the unusual blade antennae on its upper fuselage.
> 
> This newspaper has also confirmed stopovers in Malta by a Lockheed L-100 Hercules with tail number N8213G on 31 March and on 25 August 2004, a Boeing 737 with tail number N313P 6 December 2003 and a Gulfstream jet with tail number N227SV on 17 December 2004.

It seems [planespotting][4] has become a respectable journalistic enterprise.
