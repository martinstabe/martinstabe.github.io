Tomorrow it will have been 20 working days since I [filed my Freedom of Information Act request][1] with the Treasury, asking for the justification of the redactions in the earlier FOIA disclosure of [documents related to flat taxes][2].

As the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s guidance ([PDF][3]) explains, the 20-day clock starts ticking the day after the public body receives the request &mdash; so I *should* receive a reply by the close of play on Tuesday.

I&rsquo;m not holding my breath, though. In the first three months of this year, the only period for which [statistics][4] are so far available, the Treasury answered just 114 of the 277 FOIA requests it received within the statutory deadline. Only the Home Office has a worse record of casually breaching section 10 of the FOIA.
