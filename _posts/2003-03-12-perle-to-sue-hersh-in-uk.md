Now **Richard Perle** <a href="http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=NYS/2003/03/12&ID=Ar00200" target="_top">plans to sue</a> **Seymour Hersh** for libel in a British court. **Atrios **<a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_atrios_archive.html#90610674" target="_top">hopes</a> for a **Jeffrey Archer** outcome. 

Earlier this week, Perle called Hersh &#8220;the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist.&#8221; <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/752664.asp#030312" target="_top">Hersh responded</a> by saying &#8220;Forty years ago, he would have called me a communist, and 70 years ago, he would have called me a Jew. Itâ€™s the same thing with these people.&#8221; 

The reason for all this? It appears Hersh had <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030317fa_fact" target="_top">the audacity to question</a> whether there might, perhaps, be the appearance of conflicts of interest between Perle&#8217;s role as chairman of the **Defense Policy Board,** a secretive group that advises **Donald Rumsfeld**, and the fact that he is a managing partner in **Trireme Partners, L.P.**, a venture capital firm that invests in companies dealing with homeland security. 

(A completely coincidental and unrelated aside: I feel that &#8220;homeland-security-industrial-complex&#8221; is an unwieldy phrase. Any suggestions for alternatives?) 

Perle is also a director of **Hollinger International** Inc., which is an investor in the conservative *New York Sun.* But that is only mildly interesting when compared to <a href="http://users.adelphia.net/~enitria/trish_wilson/blog/archives/week_3_13_2003.html#000147" target="_top">this</a>. I wish these companies were all on the fun <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/" target="_top">interlocking directorates</a> tool that <a href="http://campuscgi.princeton.edu/~eszter/weblog/archives/00000223.html" target="_top">Eszter Hargittai</a> has found. 

Of course, &uuml;ber-hawk Perle ****has never been very good at PR and has long suffered from foot-in-mouth disease. This, after all, is a man who said **Gerhard Schr&ouml;der** <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2002/09/tapped-s-09-30.html#we2" target="_top">should resign</a> for disagreeing with President Bush.
