I am currently in a place without broadband, and it&#8217;s painful. Even something as simple as checking e-mail is an agonisingly slow experience.

I can hardly believe that I used to use the internet this way all the time.

The way broadband users &#8220;waste&#8221; bandwidth is another example of the &#8220;economics of abundance&#8221; that Chris Anderson has been writing about lately. It&#8217;s very instructive for those to using the Internet casually and quickly to remember that 56K dialup still the way many (most, in many places) people experience the Internet — it&#8217;s a resource to be switched on temporarily, for specific tasks.

The dialup experience is an Internet without social bookmarking, without VoIP, without casually throwing up a quick blog post. RSS newsreaders have to be switched off because they use a prohibitively large chunck of available bandwidth. It&#8217;s a time-consuming one-way channel, not a time-saving two-way resource. It sucks.

I&#8217;d rather read my news printed on paper or talked at me from a flickering box than via this apalling medium — worth remembering when in evangelical mode.
