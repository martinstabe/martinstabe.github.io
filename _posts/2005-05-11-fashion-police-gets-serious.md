This is almost too pathetic for words: Bluewater shopping centre is so concerned about &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; that they have opted for the obvious solution: [banning baseball caps and hooded jumpers][1] from the premises.

A mall with a dress code? WTF? Clearly this is a sensible fashion diktat, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to deter yobs.

In all seriousness, though, there is a serious political point here that gets much more attention in the United States than it does here in Britain.

In America a huge amount of what was traditionally public space has been privatised through things like gated communities and shopping centres. As a result, the the civil liberties provisions of the Constitution, which apply only to state actors, apply less and less to the spaces in which people live most of their lives.

I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready to man the barricades &mdash; or appeal to the ECHR &mdash; for the right to wear my [New Era 59Fifty][2], but clearly this is a step in the wrong direction as far as civil liberties are concerned.

Hat tip (pun intended): **[Turlough O&rsquo;Bryen][3]**.
