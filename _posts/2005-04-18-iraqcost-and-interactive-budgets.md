*WorldChanging* points out a little [Java app for mobile phones that the Liberal Democrats are distributing][1]. The [Iraqcost][2] software allows users to reallocate the &pound;5 billion that the UK has spent on the war in Iraq and send their chosen budget priorities back to the party.

And *WorldChanging* has an interesting take:

> Simplistic? Sure. Overtly political? Of course &mdash; there&rsquo;s a Parliamentary election going on in the UK right now. But it&rsquo;s also an interesting evolution of the use of mobile phones as a political tool, moving beyond communication and organization into the realm of interactive policy advocacy. It also foreshadows the possibility of doing something like this for real &mdash; sending out the budget to every citizen for allocation decisions. A staple of science fiction for decades, the notion of collaborative budgets is undoubtedly riddled with problems &#8230; But the idea of being able to tell your government precisely how to spend its money will be compelling to a great number of people.
