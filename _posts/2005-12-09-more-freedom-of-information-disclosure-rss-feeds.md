The Scottish Executive has an [RSS feed of its disclosures under the Freedom of Information Act][1] ([RSS][1]). [A few other UK public bodies have also adopted this excellect approach][2] to publishing their disclosure logs. This is a good idea and should be encouraged.

The idea seems to be catching on elsewhere, as well. The [The United States Customs and Border Protection Service][3] ([RSS][4]) is the first American FOI RSS feed that I have seen. [[ADDED 8.1.2006][5]]
