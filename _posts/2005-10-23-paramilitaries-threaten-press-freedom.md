The UK is ranked only 24th on in Reporters Sans Frontiers&rsquo; [annual Press Freedom Index][1] league table. According to the RSF press release ([PDF][2]), the apparently poor showing &ldquo;is due to the situation in Northern Ireland, where journalists continue to be threatened by paramilitary groups&rdquo;.

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland share the top spot. The imprisonment of **Judith Miller** pushed the United States to 44th.
