Glasgow City Council will [publish eateries&rsquo; food hygene reports online][1] beginning later this month.

Traditionally secret, the health inspection reports are now available using the Freedom of Information Act. Glasgow is joining a small number of councils that are following American local authorities&rsquo; example by publishing them proactively.
