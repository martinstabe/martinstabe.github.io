European Commissioner for adminstration [**Siim Kallas** wants the EU to publish details of who receives subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy][1] as part of a new drive for transparency in the European Union institutions.

The subsidies received by farmers in England were released earlier this year in one of the first high-profile tests of the Freedom of Information Act. Denmark, Estonia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia and parts of Spain have alsro released their figures.

As the figures emerged, it became clear that large argibusinesses are the major benefitiaries of the EU&rsquo;s most expensive programme.

Now France, the biggest receipient of CAP funds, is coming under the spotlight.

Oxfam says [the top 15 percent of French farming companies receive 60 percent of CAP subsidies][2], while the bottom 70 percent French farmers receive only 17 percent.
