*North Korea Zone* has an astonishing post about the contents of a 35-minute video that, if it is real, could be the [first sign organised dissent][1] against the **Kim Jong Il** regime. [Reuters also reported on the video][2], which emerged yesterday in South Korea. 

The emergence of this video follows last week&rsquo;s release of videos purportedly [filmed inside a North Korean prison camp][3].
