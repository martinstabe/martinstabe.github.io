**Juan Cole** &mdash; who is, we learned this week, the favourite blogger of both **[Seymour Hersh][1]** and [**John Simpson**][2] &mdash; looks at the [role of American bloggers][3] in ensuring that the U.S. media picked upthe *Sunday Times&rsquo;*</a> reporting on the so-called Downing Street Memo:

> If this story had broken in the 1970s, it probably would just have been buried by the mainstream US press and remained an oddity of UK&#8217;s Fleet Street. But here you have the *Times* of London actually acknowledging the wind under its sails from the blogging world!

> *[Times* reporter **Michael] Smith** not only [acknowledges][4] the pressure put on the US corporate media by the bloggers, but he also points to a virtual social movement around the DSM, with emails and petitions circulating in the hundreds of thousands and giving the Democrats in Congress their first high-profile investigatory opportunity of the Bush presidency.

> The seeping of blogistan into the pages of the *Times* of London with regard to its own scoops seems to me a bellwether of the kinds of changes that are being produced in our information environment by the blogging phenomenon. The gatekeepers at the *New York Times* and the *Washington Post* can no longer decide whether a leak is a story or a non-story. The public decides what a story is.

Cole&rsquo;s analysis is also fair to American journalists, noting that they had to be careful about running a story where they could not get hold of a copy of the original document that was the key to a politically-sensitive story leaked in the midst of an election &mdash; remember where that got **Dan Rather**?
