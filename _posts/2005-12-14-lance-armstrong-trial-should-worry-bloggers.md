Seven-time *Tour de France* winner **Lance Armstrong** will [be going on trial for defamation in Italy][1] at a trial beginning next year.

The American cyclist faces six years in jail if found guilty of criminal defamation is being sued by Italian cyclist **Filippo Simeoni**. In 2003, Armstrong called Simeoni a liar in the French newspaper *Le Monde.*

In a preliminary hearing, Armstrong&rsquo;s lawyers had questioned the court&rsquos jurisdiction over the case, but this was unsuccessful. In other words, as far as this non-lawyer can tell, it&rsquo;s another one of those Internet jurisdiction trials that online publishers including bloggers should be worried about:

> &ldquo;The judge decided that even though Armstrong&rsquo;s comments were published in France the act of defamation against Simeoni occurred when Simeoni read the newspaper via the internet,&rdquo; the Italian rider&rsquo;s lawyer **Giuseppe Napoleone** told Reuters.

The Italian court is effectively claiming global jurisdiction over anything that is published on the Internet. Echos of the [Australian forum-shopping case against Dow Jones][2], the still-simmering French [Nazi memorobilia case against Yahoo!][3], and the *de facto* [Australian gag on the *Guardian*][4] web site.

All of these have been civil cases, but it seems that defamation is actually a criminal offense in Italy, so the stakes are higher here. Hopefully, the Italian judge will look at [Canada&rsquo;s more sensible approach][5].
