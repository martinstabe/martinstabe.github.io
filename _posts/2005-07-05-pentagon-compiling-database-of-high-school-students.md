The Pentagon is creating a [database of all 16-to-18-year-old high school students][1] in the United States in an effort to improve dwindling recruitment efforts.

**Update:** The Associated Press has a story about [parents who are resisting the Pentagon&rsquo;s efforts][2], which also includes a quote from a military spokesperson saying that the new database is merely a consolidation of recruitment information-gathering that the different branches of the military used to do seperately.
