Prof. **Paul Hirst**, the British sociologist, died this week. I&#8217;m most familiar with his latest work, particularly his study of contemporary warfare and his work on the concept of globalisation, in which his name became synonymous with the sceptical position that said that reports of the death of the nation-state are greatly exaggerated. Judged on these works alone, he will be sorely missed. The [*Guardian*][1] and <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/themes/article-10-1297.jsp" target="_top">Opendemocracy.net</a> have obituaries.
