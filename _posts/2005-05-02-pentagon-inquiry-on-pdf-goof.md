The Pentagon has [launched an inquiry][1] on how secret parts of their report into the death of the Italian agent **Nicola Calipari** in Iraq came to be made public.

The report was released on Friday and published on the Internet on Saturday as a PDF document with some secret sections blacked out. But readers of the Italian newspaper *La Repubblica* [quickly discovered][2] that by simply copying the text into another text editor, they could remove the blacked-out parts of the document, revealing the sections meant to be kept secret.

**Update:** The BBC now has a [report][3] on the leak online.
