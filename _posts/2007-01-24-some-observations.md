Some completley unrelated observations:

  1. The [Chatham House rule][1] can be really, really infuriating.
  2. When you get a group of newspaper editors and executives around a large table, it is not unusual for those who also maintain blogs to make the most consistently sensible points.
  3. Even after hearing someone use &#8220;unbundling&#8221; and &#8220;reduced barriers to entry&#8221; in the same sentence, many newspaper executives find it difficult to contemplate media on anything other than a mass-market scale.
  4. In discussions among journalists, the phrase &#8220;citizen journalism&#8221; continues to be a red flag — and a red herring.
  5. Those under 20 don&#8217;t check their local paper for cinema listings — nor their local paper&#8217;s web site. See &#8220;unbundling&#8221; *op cit.*
  6. Those under 30 won&#8217;t &#8220;grow into&#8221; the habit of buying newspapers the way their parents did.
  7. If you think this has all suddenly happened in the last 12 months, you haven&#8217;t been paying attention for the last 12 years.
  8. If you think the Internet&#8217;s effect on the newspaper business is at its peak, you ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet.
  9. Paper remains a really cool medium. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it needs to be distributed the way it has been for the past four centuries. We don&#8217;t talk about distributed, digital on-demand printing enough &#8217;round here.
 10. [POLIS][2] is a very cool institution.

That is all. Good night.
