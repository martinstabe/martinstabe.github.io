After their [badly flawed][1] [story][2] on the same document last month, *Raw Story* now has discovered something far interesting about the Pentagon log of Freedom of Information Act Requests received by blogger **[Michael Petrelis][3]**.

A number of the requests came from [Republican Party staff seeking to dig dirt on Democratic opponants][4], *Raw Story* shows. The web site had already reported that [Democratic staffers are also researching Republicans][5], but were more likely than the GOP staff to reveal their affiliation in the request.

Political parties doing opposition research using FOIA requests isn&rsquo;t nearly as shocking as *Raw Story* suggests &mdash; it&rsquo;s another one of the well-known major uses of the openness legislation. Nor is there anything wrong with concealing your identity or purposes when requesting information &mdash; if there is a right to access, there is a right to access, no questions asked.

Still, *Raw Story* has done some good journalism by linking requesters&rsquo; names with other publically-available records to show that these staffers received money from campaign war chests for their efforts.

The story also highlights a weakness of the British Freedom of Information Act. The equivalent story would probably not have been possible here in Britain because FOIA requestors&rsquo; names tend to be exempt from disclosure as &ldquo;personal data&rdquo;. One way to sometimes get around this is to request the name of the organisation that made a request.
