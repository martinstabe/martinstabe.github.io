**Hendrik Hertzberg** makes an [important observation][1] in the *New Yorker:*

> What all the memorable scandals of the past thirty years&mdash;real and fake alike, from Watergate to the **Clinton** impeachment&mdash;have had in common is that the opposition party controlled at least one house of Congress, which gave it the power to hold hearings and issue subpoenas. If **Bush** ends up having an easier time of it in his second term than any of his two-term predecessors since **F.D.R.**, it won&rsquo;t be because the scandals arenâ€™t there. It&rsquo;ll be because the tools to excavate them are under lock and key.

It&rsquo;s about Gannongate, so blog navel-gazers will want to read the rest.
