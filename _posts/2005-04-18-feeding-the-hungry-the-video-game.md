Not sure what to make of this yet: the UN World Food Programme has [released a video game][1] called *[Food Force][2]:*

> The game puts players in charge of a hunger relief effort on the fictional Indian Ocean island of Sheylan, ravaged by a civil war, flooding and drought. You lead a crack multinational team of WFP professionals including a logistics officer, nutritionist and air drop specialist, and you must lead the team through six missions to bring food and supplies to the desperate natives of Sheylan &mdash; everything from air surveillance to figuring out a good balanced diet, airdropping supplies, and helping natives get the most out of their natural resources by planning future farming efforts.

I guess it&rsquo;s a step forward from using video games as a [recruiting tool for the armed forces][3].
