Although this doesn&#8217;t come as much surprise to me, **Josh Marshall** writes these <a href="" target="_top">frightening lines</a> In the *Washington Monthly:*  


> &#8230;[T]o the Bush administration hawks who are guiding American foreign policy &#8230; the invasion of Iraq was not merely, or even primarily, about getting rid of **Saddam Hussein**. Nor was it really about weapons of mass destruction, though their elimination was an important benefit. Rather, the administration sees the invasion as only the first move in a wider effort to reorder the power structure of the entire Middle East. Prior to the war, the president himself never quite said this openly. But hawkish neoconservatives within his administration gave strong hints. In February, Undersecretary of State **John Bolton** told Israeli officials that after defeating Iraq, the United States would &#8220;deal with&#8221; Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Meanwhile, neoconservative journalists have been channeling the administration&#8217;s thinking. Late last month, *The Weekly Standard&#8217;s* **Jeffrey Bell** reported that the administration has in mind a &#8220;world war between the United States and a political wing of Islamic fundamentalism &#8230; a war of such reach and magnitude [that] the invasion of Iraq, or the capture of top al Qaeda commanders, should be seen as tactical events in a series of moves and countermoves stretching well into the future.&#8221;
