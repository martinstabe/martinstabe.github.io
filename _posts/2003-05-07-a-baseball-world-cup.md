The field would consist of teams from eight to 16 countries (including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico) and would be played over a two-week stretch, most likely during spring training and in stadiums across the U.S. Over the past two years MLB International has talked with leagues in six countries, which were all receptive to the idea.

Baseball is hoping to start the 2004 season in Japan, and also in the works are regular-season series in Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
