A good example of a trendy concept: Media scholars say that audiences actively ascribe &#8220;resistant&#8221; meanings to the media messages they recieve. Some people seem to think that **Outkast**â€™s &#8220;Bombs Over Baghdad&#8221; is [a pro-war song][1]. To bad that Outkast rapper **Big Boi**, who penned it, &#8220;was strongly opposed to the U.S. invading Iraq without United Nations support and he never intended the song as a pro-war exercise.&#8221;
