I&#8217;ve been using the word &ldquo;skeptical&rdquo; a lot, and it looks unorthographic to me &mdash; and some others. What does *OED* say?

> **sceptical** *adjective* (*US* **skeptical**) inclined to doubt accepted opinions; critical; incredulous.

Aha. I&#8217;m still writing the American style I was taught in school. I have been in Britain way too long if this sort of thing gives me the niggles. And I guess I need a stylebook.

Reader **Turlough O&rsquo;Bryen** is right, though: not having sub-editors is one of the, ahem, *&ldquo;dysfunctions&rdquo;* of blogs.
