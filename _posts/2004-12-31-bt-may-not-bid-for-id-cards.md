BT may not bid for the huge contract for implementing the UK identity card because it [fears being labeled a &#8220;Big Brother company&#8221;][1]. ([Via *The Register*][2])

Meanwhile, [in the Netherlands, all people will be required to carry ID][3] beinginning on 1 January. According to Agence France-Presse, ldquo;Dutch citizens will be required to carry an identity card, a passport or a driver&rsquo;s license. Foreigners will need a passport, identity card or official immigration papers.&rdquo;
