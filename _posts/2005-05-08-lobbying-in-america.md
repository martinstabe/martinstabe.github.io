The *Open Democracy* blog *oD Today* [points out][1] [Lobby Watch][2], a new online database from the Center for Public Integrity, a group of investigative journalists who follow the money spent on political lobbying in the United States and a number of other countries (but not Britain).

The lobbying industry in a huge, largely unknown and unreported industry in Britain, too. I think we need something like the CPI here &mdash; [and in Brussels][3].
