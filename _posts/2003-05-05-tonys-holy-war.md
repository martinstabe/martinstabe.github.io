The *Times&#8217;* hagiographic account of &#8220;<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-667543,00.html" target="_top">Blair&#8217;s War</a>,&#8221; published on Saturday, really didn&#8217;t live up to the hype. It&#8217;s the usual uncritical tick-tock inside-dope account that all journalists produce when they have been compromised by special access. The best part about it was the photography. 

Still, there were some good bits:  


> “How should I start?”, Tony Blair is sitting at the same desk, staring at the same person as he was when preparing to meet the women of ITN. But this time he wants **Alastair Campbell** to give him an answer. 
> 
> **George Bush** has begun the bombing of Baghdad rather earlier than his best ally expected. &#8230; 
> 
> The Prime Minister is working on his broadcast announcement to the nation that British troops will tonight be engaged from “air, land and sea”. How should he begin it? 
> 
> &#8220;My fellow Americans,&#8221; suggests Campbell. 
> 
> Tony Blair does not even begin to laugh. &#8230; 
> 
> &#8220;What about the end?&#8221; asks the Prime Minister, impatiently scratching the side of his face. &#8230; 
> 
> &#8220;I want to end with God Bless You,&#8221; he says. 
> 
> There is a noisy team revolt in which every player appears to be complaining at once. 
> 
> &#8220;That&#8217;s not a good idea.&#8221; 
> 
> &#8220;Oh no?&#8221; says the Prime Minister, raising his voice. 
> 
> &#8220;You are talking to lots of people who don’t want chaplains pushing stuff down their throats.&#8221; 
> 
> &#8220;You are the most ungodly lot I have ever . . .&#8221; Tony Blair&#8217;s words fade away into the make-up artist&#8217;s flannel. 
> 
> &#8220;Ungodly? Count me out,&#8221; complains speechwriter **Peter Hyman**, who is Jewish. 
> 
> &#8220;That’s not the same God,&#8221; the protesters insist. 
> 
> &#8220;It is the same God,&#8221; says the Prime Minister, scribbling fiercely on his text. </blockquote> 
> 
> Whoa. Maybe **Jeremy Paxman** was on to something. All the sectarian rhetoric is certainly making athiest Alastair Campbell <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/05/04/nblair04.xml&#038;sSheet=/news/2003/05/04/ixhome.html" target="_top">rather uncomfortable</a>.**Kamal Ahmed** also <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,9061,949149,00.html" target="_top">noticed</a>.

> Nevertheless, Campbell&#8217;s spin machine at No. 10 must be in overdrive. In addition to the *Times,* some variant of the the press release &#8220;Tony Blair: Stressed-Out Moral Family Man At War&#8221; has now run in several newspapers, including the *Sun* and the *Evening Standard.* I confidently predict that the *Mirror* and the *Independent* will miss out on this coincidental series of &#8220;exclusive&#8221; stories.
