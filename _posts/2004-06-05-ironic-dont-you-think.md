[Wokette notes][1] this item from the *WaPo* [gossip column][2]:  


> Famed sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury is not very happy with filmmaker Michael Moore.
> 
> The 80-year-old author is peeved that Moore&#8217;s latest documentary, &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8243; &#8212; which just picked up the highly coveted Palme d&#8217;Or at the Cannes Film Festival &#8212; is trading on the title of Bradbury&#8217;s famous 1953 novel &#8220;Fahrenheit 451.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Michael Moore is a dumb [expletive], that&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; Bradbury told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter during a phone interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;He stole my title and changed the numbers without ever asking my permission.&#8221; Not one to hold back, Bradbury said he tried to contact Moore&#8217;s production company to express his grave displeasure, but to no avail. It would be nice, he added, if Moore changed the title of his soon-to-be released film.

I guess some people aren&#8217;t flattered when phrases they coin gain such cultural resonance that they an be used as a literary shorthand for any critical view of an authoritaian mindset. And, um, isn&#8217;t *Fahrenheit 451* a reference to the supression of critical free expression through the burning of paper?
