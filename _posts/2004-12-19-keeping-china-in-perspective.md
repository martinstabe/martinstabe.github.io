**Tyler Cowen** of Marginal Revolution quotes the following [&ldquo;fact of the day&rdquo;][1] from the *Wall Street Journal:*

> &#8230;at $1.2 trillion, Italian GDP is roughly the size of China&#8217;s, and Italy&#8217;s total foreign-trade value of $750 billion is only slightly smaller than that of the mainland.
