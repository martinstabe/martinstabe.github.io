[*New York* magazine][1]:  


> If [Judy] Miller is an extreme example of the *Timesâ€™* ultracompetitive mind-set, she is also an example of an inherent problem of journalism: its reliance on sources.

This is especially true when the key source is a now-discredited head of the Iraqi National Congress, but why isn&#8217;t the *New York Times* controversy prompting broader questions about the universal problem of journalists&#8217; reliance on sources with vested interests?
