This makes a change: *Der Spiegel* reports that there were [demonstrations in Tehran][1] in which the well-worn slogan &ldquo;Death to America!&rdquo; was augmented with &ldquo;Death to Europe!&rdquo;

According to the report, around 1,500 people took part in Friday&rsquo;s demonstrations, which criticised the European Union of trying to stifle Iran&rsquo;s ambitions to generate more nuclear-generated energy. According to *Iran Focus,* the demonstrators were [members of *Ansar-e Hezbollah,*][2] a &ldquo;Islamist vigilante group &#8230; organised by the ruling ultra-conservative faction&rdquo;.

Meanwhile, in an interview with Israeli television, **George W. Bush** said he [won&rsquo;t rule out the use of force][3] against Iran.
