[A letter][1] in <s>tomorrow</s> today&rsquo;s *Guardian:*

> I am surprised that a simple internet trawl qualifies as investigative journalism for David Aaronovitch (PR man to Europe&#8217;s nastiest regimes, G2, November 30), especially since the &#8220;trails&#8221; he follows about me are ones which I announce at the bottom of my own articles.
> 
> But I wonder if Aaronovitch&#8217;s Googling led him to use as a source an article entitled &#8220;Can a lobbyist for dictators work as a journalist?&#8221;, a recently posted attack on me which is almost identical to his own. The home page, Ukrainian Archive, which has links to all the western-backed &#8220;pro-democracy&#8221; groups in Ukraine itself, also carries virulently antisemitic articles about the Jewish proclivity for rape, and about how the gas chambers at Auschwitz could not have existed. If I am being simultaneously attacked by a former communist who now supports George Bush&#8217;s wars, and by raving Jew-baiting Ukrainian nationalists, I must be doing something right.
