When I subscribed to the *Times Higher Education Suppliment&#8217;s* e-mail newsletter, this was not the sort of thing I was expecting to recieve:  


> **Scientists grow penis in laboratory** 
> 
> US laboratory research has shown that it is possible to grow rabbit penises with a network of nerves, a development that increases the likelihood of effective penis enlargement surgery in human beings. The results, from a study at the Children&#8217;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, suggest that it should one day be possible to use tissue engineering to treat men born with ambiguous genitalia, or those who need penis reconstruction after an accident or cancer surgery. In the longer term it could be used for cosmetic purposes. *(Times)*

I&#8217;m just glad I don&#8217;t have any spam-filtering software installed, or this might never have come to my attention. 

**Update:** <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993672" target="_top">Full story here</a>. I guess it&#8217;s not as silly as it initially sounded.
