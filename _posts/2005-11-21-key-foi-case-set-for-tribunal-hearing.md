An important test of Britain&rsquo;s 11-month-old Freedom of Information Act will occur next month when [a freelance journalist will appeal a refused FOI request to the Information Tribunal][1].

Brighton journalist **Matthew Davis** requested disclosure of the amount artist **Conrad Shawcross** was paid for a temporary installation of his work at the publically-funded National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The museum refused the request on commercial confidentiality grounds and the Information Commissioner upheld their decision.

The *Times* reports that Davis intends to represent himself in the hearing against the Information Commisisoner&rsquo;s Office, which will be supported by the National Maritime Museum and the Department for Culture Media and Sport.
