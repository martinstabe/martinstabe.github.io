Earlier this week, I went to a Freedom of Information Act training session run by **Maurice Frankel** of the [Campaign for Freedom of Information][1]. I can&rsquo;t recommend this too highly. Anyone interested in using the new legislation should go to one of these training sessions if CFOI run some more.
