As a (lapsed &mdash; is that possible?) [Unitarian Universalist][1], the concept of [Unitarian Jihad][2] is utterly hilarious to me &mdash; as is [**Billmon**&rsquo;s reaction][3].

Actually, there&#8217;s a pretty serious point being made here about the alienation of religious moderates of all sorts in contemporary America. Or maybe that&#8217;s just me reading too much into a humourous column.

**Update:** My Unitarian Jihad Name is: **The Howitzer of Looking at All Sides of the Question**. [Get yours][4].
