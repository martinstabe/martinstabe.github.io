Former *FT* editor **Andrew Gowers** has a new gig as a columnist for the London *Evening Standard.*

In his debut, Gowers is scathing about British newspapers&rsquo; denial about how the internet is changing journalism.

Gowers writes that he would refuse any future offers to edit another paper because &ldquo;working in print, pure and simple, is the 21st-century equivalent of running a record company specialising in vinyl&rdquo;.

He attacks **Rupert Murdoch** for paying lip service to understanding the web while investing in costly new printing presses and DVD giveaways to gain tiny increases in circulation at the *Times* and recounts an encounter with an executive at a major technology company who gets all his news from Yahoo! Finance:

> My broader point is: the number of British newspaper outfits that have something unique to offer on the web in a global marketplace for new and comment can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

I wonder if he would count the *Standard&rsquo;s* own site among them. In a nice touch of irony, the piece doesn&rsquo;t appear to be anywhere on their awful *ThisIsLondon* site.
