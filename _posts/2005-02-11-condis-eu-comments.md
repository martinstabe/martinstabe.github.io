U.S. Secretary of State **Condoleezza Rice** concluded her [surprisingly well-received][1] European trip with an hour-long meeting in Luxembourg with a small group of European journalists, including one from the *Financial Times.* According to that newspaper&rsquo;s [front page report][2] today,

> &#8230; Rice insisted there was no conflict between a strong Atlantic alliance and greater European unity.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> Ms Rice gave forthright backing to the efforts of European governments to forge a common foreign policy, saying a &ldquo;unified&rdquo; Europe was a &ldquo;positive force&rdquo;. Acknowledging the concerns of some in the administration that the European Union might develop as rival to Washington, she said her meetings with European leaders had reinforced her perception of a strong identity of interests. &ldquo;The most powerful message I have heard here is that there is a strong desire to move forward on a common [transatlantic] agenda.&rdquo;
> 
> She indicated that Washington would not stand in the way of further integration. &ldquo;As Europe unifies further and has a common foreign policy &mdash; I understand what is going to happen with the constitution and that there will be unification, in effect, under a foreign minister &mdash; I think that also will be a very good development,&rdquo; she said.
> 
> &ldquo;We have to keep reminding everybody that there is not any conflict between a European identity and a transatlantic identity . . . but this is working.&rdquo; Anticipating **George W. Bush**&#8216;s visit to Brussels later this month, Ms Rice added: &ldquo;I very much want to call to everyone&#8217;s attention that is why the president is coming to the European Union&rdquo;.

Inside the *FT,* there&rsquo;s more from **Philip Stephens**:

> Ms Rice sought &#8230; to soothe Europe&rsquo;s neurosis about whether the US had abandoned its long-standing support for European integration in favour of divide and rule. Did she share the preference of **Donald Rumsfeld**, defense secretary, for splitting Europe into old and new? No. There had been &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; about the direction of the EU, Ms Rice said of the debate among Republicans in Washington. But the fears of some that a European identity would threaten the &ldquo;transatlantic identity&rdquo; had proved unfounded. A unified Europe was instead a &ldquo;positive force&rdquo;. So, too, would be the European foreign minister envisaged by the EU&rsquo;s constitutional treaty.

Huh. I guess the U.S. diplmats just [prefer knowing who to phone][3] to understand the European position on foreign policy issues.
