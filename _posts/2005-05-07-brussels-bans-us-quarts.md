**Don Melvin** of the Cox News Service &mdash; a U.S. news agency that serves the [Cox Newspapers][1] chain of regional papers &mdash; has put together a nice series on the global influence of the European Union.

Imagine the uproar if [this][2] were reported about pints in the UK:

> Take a close look at that Coca-Cola bottle in your refrigerator. Ever wonder why this quintessentially American concoction is sold in containers that say &ldquo;2 Liters&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;two quarts?&rdquo;
> 
> Blame it on the European Union. The EU says quarts are illegal, and bottlers &mdash; even those capping those ounces of liquid Americana &mdash; don&rsquo;t find it cost-effective to make two different sizes, one for Europe, the other for the United States.
> 
> From dictating the size of Coke bottles to dissuading Iran from pursuing its nuclear ambitions, the EU has arrived as a force to be reckoned with in the world.
> 
> Americans for years have tended to think of the European Union as merely an extension of the Common Market, a cooperative agreement intended to help the economies of European countries.
> 
> But evidence is mounting that the EU does not only aspire to be a counterweight to the United States in global affairs; it has already become one.

I can imagine the *Daily Express* headline already. But I digress.

The story notes that there are some American conservatives aren&rsquo;t too keen on extending the principle of free trade (which they are usually so fond of) across the Atlantic Ocean.

> Last year, the EU pressured the U.S. Congress, against its will, into changing American tax law and eliminating tax breaks for American companies that sold goods overseas.
> 
> &ldquo;My gut feeling about this is we fought a revolution 230 years ago to stop Europeans from telling us how we have to tax in this country,&rdquo; said **Dennis Hastert**, the speaker of the House. &ldquo;But the fact is, we have to do it. The EU and the WTO [World Trade Organization] have sort of a sword to our head. We don&rsquo;t like it, but we have to do what the Europeans are telling us to do.&rdquo;

[  
Another story][3] in the series looks at how American businesses are reacting to the influence of EU regulations. A final story looks at the [history of European integration][4] since the Second World War.

The stories quote former *Washington Post* London correspondent **T.R. Reid**, who made a very similar point about the influence of EU regulations on American businesses in his book *[The United States of Europe][5].* The series clearly seems inspired by that book.

I&rsquo;m glad to see stories like this appearing in regional newspapers in the United States: it can only help understanding of the mysterious institutions that are emerging on this side of the Atlantic.
