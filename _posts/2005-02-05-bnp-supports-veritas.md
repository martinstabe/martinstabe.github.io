*Stop Veritas* links to a press release issued by the British National Party, indicating that the British neo-Nazis&rsquo; leader, [**Nick Griffen**, is backing **Robert Kilroy-Silk**&rsquo;s new party][1] because he thinks a &ldquo;high profile anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism and anti-Islam campaign will play a very significant role&rdquo; in his own party&rsquo;s eventual <s>*Endsieg*</s> &ldquo;ultimate victory&rdquo;.
