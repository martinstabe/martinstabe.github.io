The [*Press Gazette* journalist&#8217;s blogroll feature][1] started out as an IM conversation I had with its author, [Graham Holliday][2], about which blogs rise to the top of my RSS reader when I turn on &#8220;sort by attention&#8221;, a fantastic feature in [NetNewsWire][3] that ranks your feeds in order of the proportion of its headlines that you click through to read.

Of course, there are of course plenty of other blogs that would have been included if we had had more than two pages to play with in the magazine â€” like BBC Five Live&#8217;s *Pods and Blogs* blog, by [Chris Vallance and Rhod Sharp][4]; *One Man & His Blog* by [Adam Tinworth][5]; *TwoPointOuch* by [Ian Delaney][6]; the BBC blog *[The Editors][7],* [Bobbie Johnson][8]; [Charles Arthur][9]; [Charlie Beckett][10]; [Guy Clapperton][11]; New.Journalism.Review by [Steve Hill][12]; *Magculture* by by [Jeremy Leslie][13]; *Magblog* by [Tim Holmes][14]; [Martin Moore][15] at the Media Standards Trust and the blog by [Editorial Photographers UK & Ireland][16].

Those who share my interest in how journalists use of the Freedom of Information Act will find *Open Secrets* by [Martin Rosenbaum][17] and *Your Right to Know* by [Heather Brooke][18] fascinating.

Slightly more technical blogs, but ever valuable, are *CurryBetDotNet* by [Martin Belham][19] and *The Obvious?* by [Euan Semple][20].

Bobbie Johnson recently described what is happening on these sites as &#8220;a [discussion between professional peers][21]&#8220;, and I think that sums it up nicely. The list of participants could go on and on.
