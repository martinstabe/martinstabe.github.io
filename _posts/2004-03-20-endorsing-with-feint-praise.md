John Kerry has received yet another endorsement that Fox News is likely to amplify in an attempt to discredit him. Speaking to the *Guardian,* left-wing &#8220;guru&#8221; Noam Chomsky described Kerry as a &#8220;[Bush lite][1]&#8221; who merely represents another faction of the the American &#8220;business party&#8221;. 

The differences between Kerry and Bush are slight, argued Chomsky, but &#8220;in a system of immense power, small differences can translate into large outcomes.&#8221; 

Paging Ralph Nader! Take a hint.
