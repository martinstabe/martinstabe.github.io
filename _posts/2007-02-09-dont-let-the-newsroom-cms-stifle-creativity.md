Andy Dickinson [looks at][1] the [*Croydon Advertiser&#8217;s* use Soundslides slideshows][2], which we reported in *Press Gazette* this week. 

One interesting thing about the *Advertiser&#8217;s* project is that the slideshows are actually hosted off-site on the blog of *Advertiser *Picture Editor and Chief Photographer, [David Berman][2].

Andy thinks this was a good idea for getting around the limitations imposed by the creaking content management systems many news web sites use.

&#8220;I’ve never understood why, given the restrictions of the centralised templating systems the locals are labouring under, more and more outfits don’t go to free or low cost services outside,&#8221; writes Dickinson.

Berman himself pipes up [in the comments][3]: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t hard to decide to go our own way to get the IT soloution. It just would have taken more time than I could allow.&#8221;

I know what they mean. This week, I&#8217;ve been getting reacquainted to toiling within the limitations of a &#8220;content management system&#8221;, which will henceforth be known as a &#8220;restrictive centralised templating system&#8221;, or RCTS. Arrgh.

We&#8217;re looking to make some major upgrades to our RCTS, and on thing I am trying to insist upon is a simple Unix box to host blogs and other rapid-development experimental projects. Why wait for external web developers to do things you can do much faster in-house?
