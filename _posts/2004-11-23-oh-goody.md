Yesterday, ITV&rsquo; **Nick Robertson** reported that British authorities had foiled a 9/11-style attack against Canary Wharf and Heathrow Airport. Good, if it&rsquo;s true. </p> 

Today, however, only one newspaper &ndash; The *Daily Mail* &ndash; </a>[lead with the story][1]. The *Today* programme this morning noted that it was &ldquo;pretty thinly-sourced&rdquo; and pointed out that it fits nicely into to the Government&rsquo;s agenda on the day of a [Queen&rsquo;s speech][2] that is full of law-and-order and anti-terrorism bills including really bad ideas like identity cards and juryless terrorism trials.
