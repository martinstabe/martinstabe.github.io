How&rsquo;s this for reversed global cultural flows? Via [Political Animal][1], I see that at least one American journalism professor &mdash; **Timothy Kenny** of the University of Connecticut &mdash; is upset about the [invasion of Britspeak][2] that is apparently occuring in some segments of the U.S. media.

Among the phrases Kenny doesn&rsquo;t like to hear in American English are &ldquo;send up&rdquo;, &ldquo;full stop&rdquo;, &ldquo;went missing&rdquo;, &ldquo;gone missing&rdquo; and &ldquo;queuing up&rdquo;.

Fair enough. The purity of American English clearly must be preserved &mdash; especially if Americans are intent on importing the worst British clich&eacute;s, too:

> Perhaps the most popular bit of Britspeak can be found &ldquo;at the end of the day.&rdquo; *New York Times* reporters used that phrase instead of our own &ldquo;in the end&rdquo; 14 times in 1994 and 33 times last year; in quotes, it showed up 159 times in 2004. If we aren&rsquo;t careful, the sturdy, straightforward &ldquo;in the end&rdquo; could once and for all &#8230; go missing.

Aaargh. 

(Speaking of media Britspeak, I wonder how Kenny feels about **Atrios**&rsquo; adoption of the word &ldquo;[wanker][3]&rdquo; as an all-purpose insult.)
