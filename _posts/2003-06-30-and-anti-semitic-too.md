Is [this episode of the BBC&#8217;s *Correspondent* programme][1] anti-Semitic? Israeli Government Press Office chief **Daniel Seaman** thinks [it demonised Israel][2] in a way reminicent of the Nazi propaganda rag *Der St&uuml;rmer*.  


> An Israeli government official said Sunday that a BBC program charging Israel with secretly stockpiling nuclear and chemical weapons demonized Israel in a way reminiscent of anti-Semitic tracts published in Nazi Germany. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> [The programme] also says Israel has undeclared biological and chemical capabilities and used an unknown gas against Palestinians in Gaza in February 2001 that sent 180 people to the hospital with severe convulsions. 
> 
> Israel at the time denied having used poison gas. 
> 
> The accusations are very reminiscent of the most horrible anti-Semitism,&#8221; Seaman said. &#8220;This is very reminiscent of *Der St&uuml;rmer,&#8221;* he added, referring to [a virulently anti-Semitic newspaper from Nazi-era Germany][3]. 
> 
> The *Jerusalem Post* reported Sunday that the Government Press Office intends to impose visa restrictions on BBC staff and to refuse to make officials available for BBC interviews, or to help BBC journalists facing problems with army roadblocks and airport security checks. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> &#8220;The BBC always questions and doubts Israel&#8217;s integrity,&#8221; Seaman said. &#8220;It is always putting it in some demonic context, not as a democracy fighting for survival.&#8221;</blockquote> 
> 
> Comparing the BBC to *Der St&uuml;rmer* because it doesn&#8217;t use the officially-santioned frame in its reporting. Wow &#8212; **Alistair Campbell** could learn a thing or two about hyperbole from his colleague Seaman.
