Looks like I&#8217;ll be going over to Amsterdam next week to watch Great Britain play Germany and the Netherlands play Sweden in the [European baseball championships][1]. The tournament is the biggest date in the European baseball calender. The stakes are high this year: the top six (or seven, if Greece qualify) teams will go on to a qualifying tournament for the 2004 Athens Olympics. 

Some of the handful of mentions of the upcoming European baseball Championships from around the world: 

  * My teammate **Dave Donaldson** [gets a mention][2] in the *Glasgow Evening Times.*
  * Donaldson will be joined on team Great Britain by **Drew Bignall**, a [high school pitcher from Minnesota][3]. He gets [a bigger mention][4] here.
  * LA Dodgers farmhand **Nick Theodorou**, a pinch hitter for the Las Vegas 51s who has never been to Greece, [will be representing that country][5] in the tournament and probably in next year&#8217;s Athens Olympics. 
  * Philadelphia Phillies farmhand **Alex Borgo**, who plays for the class-A Batavia Muckdogs, will be [play for Germany][6].

Not much. Stay tuned.
