I&#8217;m glad **Mark Kleiman** wrote these two excellent rebuttals (<a href="http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#200088306" target="_top">here</a> and <a href="http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#200125141" target="_top">here</a>) of **Amatai Etzioni**&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amitai-notes.com/blog/archives/000035.html" target="_top">view of France</a>. Kleiman is right to say that when someone of Etzioni&#8217;s stature and intellect starts making &#8220;freedom fries&#8221; arguments, &#8220;some sort of limit has been reached, and it&#8217;s time to call the meeting to order.&#8221; 

Kleiman also placed himself on my blogroll with <a href="http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#200139586" target="_top">these wise words</a> in response to another silly post:  


> It&#8217;s not pacifism to have as one&#8217;s goal making war as irrelevant as possible. That&#8217;s a perfectly workable goal. War is already irrelevant to practical politics on the North American mainland. 
> 
> If the European Union holds together, war will become similarly irrelevant to a similar-sized population. In a long view, whether Germany and France backed the US and the UK against Iraq is trivial compared to the overwhelming fact that Germany and France aren&#8217;t even thinking about fighting each other, or Britain; for the first time since the Dark Ages, Western Europe isn&#8217;t at war or preparing for war. The faster that zone of we&#8217;re-not-going-to-fight-one-another expands, the better.

I wish a few more people, particularly **Robert Kagan**, could grasp the historical significance of this monumental political achievement instead of seeing it as a source of ridicule.
