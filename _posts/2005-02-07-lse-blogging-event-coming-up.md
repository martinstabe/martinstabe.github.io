The London School of Economics media alumni group is hosting an event on 28 February that may interest bloggers in London. 

Here&rsquo;s how the e-mail describes the topic of &lsquo;The Fall and Fall of Journalism&rsquo;:

> The panel of speakers will debate whether the traditional role of journalists is being usurped by simply anyone who has access to a digital camera, camcorder and the internet. This debate will explore the new phenomena of citizen reporting, blogging and other new technology/new media-enabled reporting.

The speakers will be **Leslie Bunder**, Editor of [journalistic.co.uk][1]; blogger **Suw Charman** of [Corante Research][2] and *[Chocolate and Vodka][3];* **John Lloyd**, Editor of the *Financial Times Magazine;* Professor **Robin Mansell**, Dixons Chair in New Media and the Internet at LSE.

Sounds interesting. More details can be found [here][4].
