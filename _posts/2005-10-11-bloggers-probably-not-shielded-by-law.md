[Bloggers will &ldquo;probably not&rdquo; be considered journalists][1] for the purposes of the proposed US law to shield reporters from being compelled to testify in court, says the bill&rsquo;s sponsor.

The Free Flow of Information Act of 2005 would cover &ldquo;any entity that disseminates information by print, broadcast, cable, satellite, mechanical, photographic, electronic, or other means and that publishes a newspaper, book, magazine, or other periodical in print or electronic form; operates a radio or television station (or network of such stations), cable system, or satellite carrier, or channel or programming service for any such station, network, system, or carrier; or operates a news agency or wire service.&rdquo;

Senator **Richard Lugar,** who is sponsoring the bill, told journalists that this definition probably does&rsquo;t cover bloggers. I hope he&rsquo;s wrong about his own law. I think I&rsquo;m an &ldquo;entity that disseminates information by electronic means and and that publishes a periodical in electronic form&rdquo;.

But if he&rsquo;s right, this is another example of why it is [dangerious to create a legal definition of journalism][2]. Invariably, such definitions will fail to cover some of those people who need access to a public-interest exemption to testifying about confidential sources.
