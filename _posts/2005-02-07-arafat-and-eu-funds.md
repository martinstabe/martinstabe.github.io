From the *Financial Times&rsquo;s * investigation into **Yassir Arafat**&rsquo;s fortune:

> The European Commission&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Office is completing an investigation into whether European Union aid to the [Palestinian] authority ended up supporting terrorism. In November it said Palestinian financial controls were not yet sufficient &ldquo;to exclude all risk of misuse&rdquo;.

There hasn&rsquo;t been much reported about the [OLAF][1] investigation [since November][2]. It should be interesting to see what they conclude &mdash; and how this long-running story will be spun.
