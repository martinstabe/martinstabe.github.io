How did I manage to miss [this gem][1]? Here&rsquo;s a [exchange][2] in Gwent last week: 

> **Mark Choueke** [reporter for the *South Wales Argus]:* How did you and your cabinet colleagues react to **Peter Law**&rsquo;s decision to quit the party after 35 years service to Blaenau Gwent as a Labour politician?
> 
> John Prescott: It didn&rsquo;t even register with us. The voters just have one choice, vote Labour otherwise they&rsquo;ll end up with a Tory government. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that some of our decisions upset some people.
> 
> MC: But this isn&rsquo;t about upsetting Peter Law, it&rsquo;s about upsetting the many thousands of Labour voters in Blaenau Gwent who helped you form a strong government they feel alienated.
> 
> JP: Why are you asking me about this, I don&#8217;t care, it&rsquo;s a Welsh situation, I&rsquo;m a national politician.
> 
> MC: Are you too big to care about the Labour voters in Blaenau Gwent? Do you think there may be something in your party&#8217;s methods of working that require a rethink when a politician chooses to stand against you after 35 years service to Labour?
> 
> JP (walking away): Where do they get these amateurs from? You&#8217;re an amateur mate, go get on your bus, go home.
> 
> MC: Are you too big for the regional press now John?
> 
> JP: Bugger off &mdash; get on your bus you amateur.
> 
> MC (Following Deputy Prime Minister): Is my interview over John? Because if that&#8217;s all you&rsquo;ve got to say, that&#8217;s what will go in the paper.
> 
> JP (turns aggressively back to reporter): Ooohh, I&rsquo;m scared, go ahead, put it in your paper.
> 
> Labour candidate for Monmouth **Huw Edwards**: I could answer this question for you Mark&#8230;
> 
> MC: I hoped to hear what the deputy prime minister had to say about it.
> 
> JP (now ignoring reporter): I&rsquo;ve never seen a school in such a lovely setting.
> 
> MC: Is that my interview over? 

At least Prescott didn&rsquo;t [hit the guy][3]. How is this man is the *Deputy Prime Minister?*
