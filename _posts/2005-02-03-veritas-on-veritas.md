**Robert Kilroy-Silk** MEP is back. As long expected, the permatanned one yesterday [launched his own political party][1], Veritas. **Nick Barlow** has [details][2].

Veritas is a [predictably][3] right-populist, anti-immigration party.

Let the fun begin.

*Honourable Fiend* noticed that the new party is [too cheap][4] to register its domain names properly, leaving its web site littered with unsightly ads for a free hosting company. No matter &mdash; a [Google bomb][5] of [Veritas][6] is under way already and **Daniel Davies** at *Crooked Timber* says [the party is doomed anyway][7]. Until that happens, there&rsquo;s a Vertas-Watch blog, *[Stop Veritas][8].*

Meanwhile **Nosemonkey** of *Europhobia* jokes that the party may someday have a [trademark dispute][9] on its hands from a [rather large software company][10].

We know of only three Veritas members so far.

One is London Assembly member **Damian Hockney**, who has [defected from UKIP][11] to join the new party and is expected to become its deputy leader.

The other is **Anthony Bennett**, the man who *The Guardian* [reported][12] today, was registered as the official chairman of Veritas until yesterday. Bennett was fired from UKIP last year after publishing a pamphlet describing the prophet Muhammad as a paedophile, and once worked with **Ian Anderson**, a former chairman of the National Front, on the People&#8217;s Campaign to Keep the Pound. Classy.
