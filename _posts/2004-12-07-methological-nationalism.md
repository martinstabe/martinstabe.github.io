I&rsquo;ve stumbled across this excellent paper on &ldquo;methodological nationalism&rdquo; ([PDF][1] by **Andreas Wimmer** and **Nina Glick Schiller**, whcih neatly explains the tricky issue of how the social sciences have fallen into the ontological trap of taking the present nation-state system as a given, taking the national as natural.
