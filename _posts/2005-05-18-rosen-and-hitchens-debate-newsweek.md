NYU journalism professor **Jay Rosen** was paired with **Christopher Hitchens** on the BBC&rsquo;s Today programme this morning to talk about the *Newsweek* brouhaha. ([RealAudio][1])

Hitchens &mdash; fresh from being [ called][2] a [&ldquo;drink-soaked former Trotskyist popinjay&rdquo;][3] by **George Galloway** &mdash; defended *Newsweek&rsquo;s* journalism on the grounds that it&rsquo;s not journalists&rsquo; job to act as stenographers for government reports.

Without directly endorsing the comment, Hitchens also noted that the American right was convinced that this case was evidence of &ldquo;a propagandistic agenda on the part of the liberal media&rdquo; to undermine the American war effort. 

But when Rosen interrupted to reject this as part of &ldquo;an ideologicial agenda to discredit and decertify the press&rdquo; by the American right, Hitchens replied this way:

> I think that a story with such &mdash; as we now know &mdash; scant basis to it would be much less likely to appear if it made the adminstration look good. I do think that. I can&rsquo;t tell you how I know it; I read the press with great attention, I think I know when a reporter is slightly nudging me in one direction or another.

Hitch says, so it must be true. Rosen has [more on *Newsweek&rsquo;s* error][4] at his blog, *PressThink.*

**Update:** [Rosen&rsquo;s take on the *Today* exchange][5] is now up on *Press Think.*
