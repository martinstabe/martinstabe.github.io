I&#8217;ve just had a call from someone on the BBC&#8217;s *Today* programme, who is looking for someone to come on the radio tomorrow morning to comment on [Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s proposed blogger Code of Conduct][1].

<s>It seems they are having a bit of trouble finding someone who actually thinks it&#8217;s a good idea â€” and who is in a reasonable time zone for an early-morning slot.</s>

Balanced BBC coverage of course demands a voice in favour to counter all those against, and it seems that the lack of dripping vitriol in [my earlier post][2] on the topic has made me a potential candidate for the gig.

I actually think the code is a rather bad idea, but didn&#8217;t feel the need to re-hash all the arguments that have been laid out by many, many others already when I posted about it earlier today. Personally, I think Neil McIntosh [sums up the arguments against][3] best over at *Complete Tosh.*

<s>So come out of the woodwork if you&#8217;re in favour. The Beeb wants to hear from you. Leave a comment below or drop me an e-mail and &#8216;ll pass it along.</s>

**Update:** It seems Tim O&#8217;Reilly himself has been tracked down and will be appearing on *Today* tomorrow morning.

**Update, 9am 12/4:** Looks like the item didn&#8217;t make it on the programme after all.
