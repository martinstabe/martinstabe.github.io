Yesterday, the BBC ran a facinating documentary called [Club Class][1]. It was about the Bilderberg Group, the secretive meeting of global elites from across the political spectrum. Unlike most BBC radio programmes, there seems to be no RealAudio archive of the programme to link to. 

Cue X-Files theme tune.
