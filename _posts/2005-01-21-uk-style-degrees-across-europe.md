Forty European countries have agreed to adopt a [British-style system of university degrees][1] by 2010. 

This will clarify the compartitive value of degrees earned under the various degree structures used across Europe.

After 2010, the 40 countries will have first degrees that last for three or four years leading to a Bachelor&rquo;s degree and first postgraduate degrees lasting one- or two years leading to a Master&rsquo;s.
