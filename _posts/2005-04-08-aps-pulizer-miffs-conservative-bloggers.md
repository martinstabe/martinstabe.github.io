*LGF* is [outraged][1] that the [Pulizer Prize for Breaking News Photography][2] was awarded to the Associated Press &mdash; you know, one of those MSM organisations whose local stringers in Iraq have been putting their necks on the line to provide blog-fodder for those of us in our pyjamas.

The problem, it seems, is that one of the AP pictures was the subject of [unsubstantiated][3] [allegations][4] of an AP stringer&rsquo;s complicity with insurgents at the time that it was taken.

It&rsquo;s worth revisiting *Dead Parrot Society&rsquo;s* fairly comprehensive demolition of the demonization memes surrounding the AP&rsquo;s [Haifa Street photograph][5], in part because the telling and re-telling of the slanted version of this episode until it is established as fact belies the [myth of the self-correcting blogosphere][6].

**Update:** *Dead Parrot Society* has added [a powerful post on this][7] today.
