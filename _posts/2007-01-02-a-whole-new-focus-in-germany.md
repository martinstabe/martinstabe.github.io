Several German news web sites will be relaunching in early 2007 with a host of “web 2.0” features in a bid to catch up with the dominant *[Spiegel Online][1]. *

The cover story of November&#8217;s issue of the German journalists&#8217; trade magazine [*Medium*][2] has a lengthy set of stories about the relaunch of *[Focus Online][3],* which is expected to happen this month.

Since his appointment last January, the *Focus Online’s* editor, [Jochen Wegner][4], has been tasked with helping the companion site for newsweekly *Focus* catch up with its rival *Der Spiegel.*

The site will end its partnership with MSN that has seen focus.de redirect to focus.msn.de, and implement a clutter-free redesign.

Interactivity and personalisation are central to the “community” elements that Wegner describes as one of &#8220;three pillars” to his stategy.

The first pillar is use of  &#8220;classical journalism&#8221; — virtually the entire print newsroom is now filing for *Focus Online* and there is growing cooperation with Focus TV for new multimedia offerings. *Focus Online* has hired eight additional editoral staffers of its own.

Wegner&#8217;s second pillar is usability — the new site will include more better use of its archives and aims to make everything on the site accessible within three clicks. Tagging will play a major role in this.

Finally, the community elements of the new site will include two major features. One is [Focus Online LIVE][5]. A trial version of this Flickr-like photo- and video-sharing site went live during the World Cup this summer.

The second is &#8220;Mein Focus&#8221;, which will allow users to create personalised start pages, including RSS feeds from other publications — even *Spiegel Online* will be included, Wegner insists.

The next step, he says, is to let users add tags to stories within their personal space on the site.

Wegner told Medium that &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; is a buzzword which will barely have registered with most of his readers. Only a tiny proportion of his audience will know what a tag cloud is or how tagging works. But this doesn&#8217;t stop him from using them, he says.

Wegner will have to peer over his shoulder a bit, because [*Welt Online*][6] has a 30-strong staff under Christoph Keese which also plans a relauch from the *Welt* group’s new integrated newsroom within the first quarter of this year.  
*Spiegel Online* leads the German online news market with 314 million page impressions in October 2006, according to *Medium. FAZ.net* and *Sueddeutsche.de* had 60m each, with Welt Online trailing at 30m.
