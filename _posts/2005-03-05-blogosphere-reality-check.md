A [new poll conducted for CNN][1] and *USA Today* by Gallup confirms the blog readership figures found by [Pew&rsquo;s research][2] a few months back. CNN gives it a decidedly negative spin:

> &#8230; a poll released Thursday finds that few computer users are tuned in to the blog phenomenon.
> 
> More than three-quarters of Americans &mdash; 76 percent &mdash; said they use the Internet, but only 26 percent said they were &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; or &ldquo;somewhat familiar&rdquo; with blogs.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> Just 7 percent of adults said they read blogs at least a few times per week, according to the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. Forty-eight percent said they never do.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> The poll was based on telephone interviews of 1,008 American adults carried out February 25-27. It has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.

Presuming that the figures for both Internet usage and the blog awareness among Internet users are probably even lower here in Britain, it&rsquo;s tempting to read this as more evidence that British blogging is a [complete waste of time][3].

But perhaps all this misses the point. It&rsquo;s not mass readship that matters. Insofar the blogosphere has demonstrated any sort of real influence, it has been through a symbiotic relationship with the much-derided mainstream media. 

By drastically accelerating the post-publication fact-checking of dubius stories and by amplifying under-reported stories, blogging has changing the monopoly on agenda-setting that the mainstream news media previously enjoyed. But this only works because reporters and editors read blogs and take them seriously. 

Presumably the same challenge of traditional opinion-leaders&rsquo; dominance of specialist discourses is the what marks the non-political blogosphere.

Perhaps bloggers shouldn&rsquo;t worry about polls like this one: A relatively small, elite readership may be what really matters most for the blogosphere.

**Update:** *Micro Persuasion* says [more or less the same thing][4].
