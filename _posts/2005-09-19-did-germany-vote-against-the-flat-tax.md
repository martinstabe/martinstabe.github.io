The only thing clear so far in the German election is is that **Angela Merkel** had a disasterous result. Widely exepected to win easily, her conservative CDU/CSU ended up a hairs-breadth plurality.

Things may have turned sour for her when she appointed flat-tax advocate Prof. **Paul Kirchhof** as her potential finance minister.

This allowed **Gerhard Schr&ouml;der** to attack Merkel for apparently favouring radically neo-liberal economic agenda. It seems to have worked.

**Update: Michael Stickings** of *Moderate Voice* has [a similar view][1].
