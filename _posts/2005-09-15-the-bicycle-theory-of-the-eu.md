The European Union&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States, **John Bruton**, says Americans are &ldquo;unfazed&rdquo; by the EU&rsquo;s constitutional difficulties.

*EUObserver* quotes [a speech][1] by the former Irish prime minister:

> &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t see every problem as an existential crisis&rdquo;, he said adding that Europeans tend to believe the &ldquo;bicycle theory&rdquo; whereby if the Union stops going forward it will fall over.

He makes some other interesting observations, too:

> &ldquo;Americans are not ignorant about Europe and many have a very deep knowledge of Europe. They are interested in what we are doing&rdquo; &#8230;
