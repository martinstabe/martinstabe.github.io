In a recent Twitter exchange, [Jay Rosen][1] explained [why journalists refer to the first &#8220;graf&#8221; of their stories as a &#8220;lede&#8221;][2], a quirk of [jargon that had puzzled Dave Winer][3]. 

Except, of course, that here in Britain we do no such thing. To British hacks (a term which is not quite the pejorative it is in America) the first &#8220;par&#8221; of a story is the &#8220;intro&#8221;. No risk of confusing that with the lead that used to be used to seperate lines of type.

Apparently, some journalists take this jargon-translation a step further.

We [recently learned][4] that at the Financial Times, at least, what Yanks call the &#8220;nut graf&#8221; is known, naturually, as [the &#8220;bollocks par&#8221;][5].

(For civilians, the &#8220;[nut graf][6]&#8221; is the paragraph that explains why a newspaper story, usually a feature, is significant.)
