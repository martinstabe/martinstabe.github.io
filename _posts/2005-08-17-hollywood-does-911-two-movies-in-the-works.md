The taboo on Hollywood depictions of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 appears to be over, the BBC World Service reports.

Two movies are in the works: *Flight 93* by director **Paul Greengrass** and a still untitled film by **Oliver Stone** about two police officers trapped in the Ground Zero rubble.

They may be pitted against one another next summer because the studios don&#8217;t want to be accused of cashing in on the fifth anniversary of the attacks next autumn.

**Update:** The story was [picked up from *Variety.*][1]
