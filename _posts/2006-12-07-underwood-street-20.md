*Press Gazette&#8217;s* comeback issue is [out in print today][1].

New *Press Gazette* owners Wilmington Media have also made an important early move to reduce costs by [moving the magazine out of Fleet Street][2].

As several bloggers have pointed out, the previous regime&#8217;s [move to Fleet Street just three months ago][3] didn&#8217;t make much sense beyond a short-term publicity stunt, since the biggest employers on the Street of Shame these days are law firms and investment banks.

So as much as [we enjoyed][4] [the Old Bell][5], the old hacks&#8217; haunts would not have yielded any stories over a liquid lunch â€” except perhaps the odd libel case.

The name of my column won&#8217;t be affected, but the magazine&#8217;s fourth home in just over a year is in [Underwood Street][6], near Old Street. The move is a good sign that the title will benefit from the economies of scale inherent in being part of a larger publishing stable.

Best of all, it looks like the new local is the [Bavarian Beerhouse][7]. A bonus for returning staff: bratwurst.
