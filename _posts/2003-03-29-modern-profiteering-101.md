Blogger just ate up a ton of work I did translating parts of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,242394,00.html" target="_top">this article</a> from *Der Spiegel* about the role of Private Military Companies (PMCs) in the war on Iraq. Since most of it&#8217;s a rewrite from this excellent <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,427948,00.html" target="_top"><i>Fortune</i> magazine article</a>, I won&#8217;t do it all again. Go read either version: it features **Dick Cheney&#8217;s** former employers, **Halliburton,** whose PMC subsidary, **Kellogg, Brown & Root** stands to make a packet on the Iraq war. What a surprise. 

Here&#8217;s the original bit tranlated:  


> &#8220;PMCs fit the concept of the lean state,&#8221; says military researcher Prof. **<a href="http://www.bicc.de/info/staff/wulf.html" target="_top">Herbert Wulf</a>**. Hiring them is considered an &#8220;effective and market-based method&#8221; &#8212; particularly in the case of &#8220;dirty conflicts&#8221; like rebellions. The danger is that the gradual privatiation of military functions undermines the state monopoly on force. &#8220;The specialist firms operate quietly, effiently and frequently far from parliamentary control,&#8221; warns Wulf. &#8220;We have to ensure that this oversight is not pried away.&#8221; 
> 
> The most important activities for the PMCs are not &#8220;combat jobs&#8221; but logistical support. Government troops are meant to consentrate on their core competence &#8212; fighting. The rest is outsourced: support roles like the construction of training camps, the maintainence of machines and technology, and the provision of food are eagerly taken up by military contractors. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> The big global PMCs will also advance closer to the enemy where necessary. &#8230; Supporters say that the PMCs strengths can be played upon particularly in delicate missions. They act quickly, flexibly, and without long discussions in international bodies. They don&#8217;t need Security Council Resolutions &#8230; 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> According to U.S. military strategist **Thomas Adams,** the Private Military Companies have long become an an extention of foreign policy. They not only act faster, but also more discretely. It is a nightmare for every country when its own troops killed in action have to be brought home. But with private contractors, there&#8217;s no funeral with military honours.</blockquote>
