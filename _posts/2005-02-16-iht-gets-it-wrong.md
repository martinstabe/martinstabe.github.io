Um&#8230; the European Court of Human Rights is not an &ldquo;[EU Court][1]&rdquo;, as this *IHT* headline asserts.

Unlike the European Court of Justice, the ECHR is not an EU institution. It&rsquo;s an institution of the Council of Europe, which is also not an EU institution.

If a major international newspaper with relatively strong coverage of European politics can&rsquo;t get the institutions straight, what hope is there for the readership of the rest of Anglophone press of getting correct information?
