Press Gazette reporter Rachael Gallagher filmed some [video vox pops][1] this week to gauge Londoners’ opinions of the *Evening Standard* and the free newspapers *London Lite* and *thelondonpaper. *You can [watch the results on YouTube][2].

But this is two stories in one. It was also a review for the Gizmos page.

Rachael filmed her vox pops on the hands-free &#8220;headcam&#8221; better known as the [Cylon Body-Worn Surveillance System][3]. The tiny camera, designed to be strapped to the side of the user’s head, records directly to an Archos digital video recorder.

The headcam was designed for police evidence-gathering, which explains the unsightly timestamp throughout Rachael’s footage. Apparently the manufacturers can make a version for journalists without this feature.

There are clearly journalistic applications for this device, particularly in areas where mobility is vital, such as war reporting. Tristan Nichols, defense correspondent of *The Herald* in Plymouth, recently used this camerato film stories about British troops in [Sierra Leone][4] and [Afghanistan][5].

And it costs a mere £1,700.
