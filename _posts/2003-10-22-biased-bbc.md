Next time someone tells you the BBC is a bastion of The Liberal Media, here&#8217;s yet another not-so-radical reporting convention to point out. Compare and contrast. 

According to my *OED:*  


> **casualty** &#8230; *noun* &#8230; person killed or injured in war or accident.</p>
But, as an e-mail from BBC news online [reported by Atrios][1] makes clear, the word&#8217;s definintion in the BBC stylebook doesn&#8217;t derive from the *OED:*

> Thank you for your email. We use US Central Command&#8217;s definition of casualties in the war in Iraq, which only refers to those who have been killed. Thank you for your interest in the BBC News website.
