The blogosphere&#8217;s miserable failure on the tsunami stor

One of the most widely-blogged issues of the tsunami so far has been the claim that United Nations Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs **Jan Egeland** had [accused the United States of being &ldquo;stingy&rdquo;][1] in its response to the tsunami.

The *IHT* today mentioned that **Colin Powell** had, in a CNN interview, [&#8220;indignantly rejected&#8221; that the US is stingy][2].

The fact that the *Washington Times* was the only source that initially made the claim should have rung alarm bells.

The fact is, as *Gadflyer&rsquo;s* **Joshua Holland** notes, [Egeland never did single out the United States][3].

Chalk up another success story for the fact checkin&rsquo; blogosphere.

Well, not really. Just Joshua Holland.

What&#8217;s interesting is how many blog posts refered to the *Washington Times* article without questioning what it said. I guess a skeptical view of the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; gets suspended when it reports views useful to your point of view.
