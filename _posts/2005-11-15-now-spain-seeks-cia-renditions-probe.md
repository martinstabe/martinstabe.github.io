Spain is joining the growing list of European countries that are investigating CIA &ldquo;extraordinary renditions&rdquo; on their territory.

[Spanish police have opened a criminal investigation][1] into the frequent stopovers by aircraft linked to renditions on the Spanish island of Majorca.

[Italy and Germany are already seeking to arrest CIA agents][2] involved in one rendition operation that allegedly began with a kidnapping on a street in Milan.
