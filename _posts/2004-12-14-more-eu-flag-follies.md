On Friday, the *Worcestershire Evening News* ran the [following story][1]:

> FLYING the flag of the European Union during VE Day celebrations in Droitwich would not incite violence. 
> 
> That was the opinion of the people in the town when the *Evening News* took to the streets.
> 
> The issue arose following a meeting of [Droitwich Town Council][2]&rsquo;s community amenities committee on Monday when some members of the committee believed that flying the flag could incite violence.
> 
> But Councillor **Don Lawley** who spoke of threats of flag burning said he felt his comments were taken out of context. &#8230;

Eh? Why would the EU flag incite violence? Does UKIP have a fanatical fringe we haven&#8217;t heard about yet?
