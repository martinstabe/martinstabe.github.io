[Nice][1]:

> Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association jointly announced Wednesday that the &ldquo;World Baseball Classic,&rdquo; a 16-nation tournament featuring the world&#8217;s best players competing for their home countries, will be played in March 2006.

The European contingent, no doubt, will be from Italy and the Netherlands, which dominate this minority sport in these parts. But perhaps this is something for the [Great Britain national baseball team][2] to aim for &mdash; in the very, very long term.
