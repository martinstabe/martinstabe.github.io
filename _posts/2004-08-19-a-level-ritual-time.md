It&#8217;s [A-Level results day][1] here in Britain. And that means it&#8217;s time for the annual August ritual debate about whether the 20-year-old trend of improving marks means the British secondary school exams are getting easier. In response, the the former Chief Inspector of Schools, **Mike Tomlinson**, is talking about adding [a 4,000 essay][2] to the A-Level requirements to help universities differentiate between applicants with high A-Level scores. An &#8220;extended essay&#8221; of this length is already a requirement in the International Baccalaureate, which I took when I left high school (gulp!) seven years ago. For purely selfish reasons, I wish Britain would just adopt the IB *in toto.* This would save me from constantly having to explain my educational credentials on job applications.
