As those who [stalk me on Twitter][1] or Facebook already know, yesterday was my final day working at [Press Gazette][2].

Next Thursday, I will be joining [Emap][3] as online editor of [Retail Week][4]. There are some interesting digital plans afoot at Emap, so I&#8217;m very excited to be part of it.

I&#8217;ll continue watching developments in online journalism on this blog. But of course my move to Emap will limit what I can and do [blog about what is going on there][5], that everything on this blog is my personal opinion and that nothing here necessarily reflects the views or options of my new employers.
