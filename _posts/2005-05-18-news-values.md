If you live in Britain, you couldn&rsquo;t have missed it, because it was on all the front pages, including the *Guardian:* cheese pop singer [**Kylie Minogue** has breast cancer][1]. 

Minogue&rsquo;s cancer story is [hardly unique][2], and I guess any peg to inform people about this is better than none.

Still, **Tim Ireland** is right to be [unimpressed][3] by the news values that knocked [Uzbekistan][4] and the Queen&rsquo;s Speech (including [National Identity Cards][5]) further down &mdash; [or completly off][6] &mdash; the front pages.

When flipping over the *Guardian* to see what news is hidden below the fold, be sure to read **Oliver Burkeman**&rsquo;s [excellent sketch][7] on Gorgeous **George Galloway**&rsquo;s little performance yesterday.
