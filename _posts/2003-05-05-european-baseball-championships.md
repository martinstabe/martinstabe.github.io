Just discovered that the web site for baseball&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ecbaseball2003.com/web/index.asp" target="_top">Euro 2003</a> is now up. A couple of my <a href="http://www.brightonbuccaneers.com" target="_top">Buccaneers</a> teammates will be playing in this tournament for Great Britain, and I&#8217;m thinking about going over to the Netherlands to support them. Should be amazing.
