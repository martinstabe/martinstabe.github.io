[The German tabloid *Bild* is to go, um, tabloid][1].

The German equivalent of Britain&#8217;s *Sun* is actually printed on a large, broadsheet-sized paper, but will test the narrower format used by its British cousins later this year. The move follows the Axel-Springer-Verlag&#8217;s trials in Frankfurt and Berlin with a [tabloid-sized version of the upmarket weekly *Die Welt*][2].

The German publisher&#8217;s experiments follow a trend set in the British Isles by the successful move to tabloid-size paper by *The Independent,* *The Irish Independent* and *The Times,* as well as the reported [plans by *The Guardian* to move to the 470ï¿½315 mm *Berliner* paper size][3] (used by its namesake, *Le Monde* and *El Pais)* by 2006.
