A must read today is **Johann Hari**&rsquo;s [shrill profile **G. Gordon Liddy**][1]. After learning all about Liddy&#8217;s fascination with Hitler and Nazi-like fascination with ruthless will-power. After listening to Liddy rant in New York&rsquo;s Penn Station, Hari concludes:

> I&rsquo;m not sure how much of this I can take. I am becoming desensitized to his madness; I haven&rsquo;t even furrowed my brow for the past five minutes. Does he really mean this stuff? And what&rsquo;s better &mdash; if he is spewing all this hate for effect, or if he really means it?
> 
> But this is how Hate Radio works in America. It numbs you to far right positions; it makes the most depraved politics banal and commonplace. So **Ann Coulter** talks affectionately of &ldquo;the benefits of local fascism&rdquo; and nobody blinks. **Michael Savage** describes <storng>Lindy England as &ldquo;an American hero&ldquo; and tells gay listeners, &ldquo;I hope you get AIDS and die,&rdquo; and we simply avert our gaze. Even a mad criminal like G. Gordon Liddy is accepted as a normal part of the political furniture. Republican politicians appear on his show happily and nod along to his far-right patter.</storng>
