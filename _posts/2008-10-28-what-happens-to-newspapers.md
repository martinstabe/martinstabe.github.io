I&#8217;ll be participating in a New Media Knowledge debate tonight entitled [What Happens to Newspapers?][1].

Also on the panel are [Neil McIntosh][2] of the Guardian, [Justin Williams][3] of the Telegraph, Mike Rowley from [Northcliffe Media][4] and Tim Gopsill from the NUJ&#8217;s magazine [The Journalist][5].

It&#8217;s a hugely broad topic, so I&#8217;m curious which direction the conversation will take. Chairman [Nico Macdonald][6] has sent round a set of questions, which give an indication of the themes he&#8217;s interested in exploring:

  * What is driving change? IT, social trends, competition?
  * What value do people get from newspapers? Has this changed?
  * How has the moral authority of and trust invested in newspapers changed?
  * How is the relationship to broadcasters and other media, local news, wire services changing
  * Who are the new competitors: non-UK newspapers, broadcasters, free sheets (eg: Metro, Short List), the Drudge Report, Daily Beast, Huffington Post, DayLife?
  * Will all content be free and, perhaps, follow music into the &#8216;loss leader for physical experiences&#8217; model?
  * Why when we are wealthier than ever (OK, *were*) we have been so reluctant to pay for the products of the news media?
  * What new editorial models are being developed: newspaper as curator/aggregator
  * New other developments have we seen: MyTelegraph, Comment is Free, instant feedback and correction
  * What new business models are being developed: commerce related recommendation, exploiting the distribution chain to attract new forms of advertising (eg: Observer Sport Monthly), recommending local services
  * What technologies do newspaper publishers need, eg: e-paper
  * What role does quality of experience have in newspapers: increasing materiality of print?
  * What ideas exist for radical change: oursourcing non-core competencies, etc.
  * Is there a role for &#8216;co-opetition&#8217;, between established and new/small publication?
