There were two interesting interviews on *Today,* the BBC&#8217;s morning current affairs radio program, this week. 

On Thursday, **John Humpries** tied British defense secretrary **Geoff Hoon** up in knots as Hoon tried to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/radio4/today/listen/audiosearch.pl?ProgID=1051177006" target="_top">justify</a> (RealAudio) the <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,942595,00.html" target="_top">possible exclusion of the United Nations</a> in any resumed search for Iraqi weapons of mass distruction. 

And on Friday, **Robin Cook** once again <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin//radio4/today/listen/audiosearch.pl?ProgID=1051252956" target="_top">picked apart</a> (RealAudio) his former colleagues&#8217; strange logic for justifying the war.
