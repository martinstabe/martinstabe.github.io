What&#8217;s the best PR strategy for ensuring that everybody in your major customer constituency reads a negative story about your company?

Google seems to have found it by making [every reporter at *CNet* *persona non grata*][1] among the search engine&rsquo;s communications folks. The technology news site had dared to publish a story that demonstrated the [privacy implications of Google][2] by using the search engine&rsquo;s own technology to unearth details of CEO **Eric Schmidt**&rsquo;s personal life.

Needless to say, this spat as now been commented upon by every [major blogger][3] in the universe &mdash; oh, [and the *New York Times.*][4] (The *Guardian&rsquo;s* news blog is [not all that impressed][5], either.)

Meanwhile, commmenters on Google employee **Jason Shellen**&rsquo;s blog correctly reject his argument that there is a [difference between &ldquo;public data&rdquo; and &ldquo;publicizing data&rdquo;][6]. The point is that Google has rendered that distinction trivial. That&rsquo;s the whole point of the article that started all this!
