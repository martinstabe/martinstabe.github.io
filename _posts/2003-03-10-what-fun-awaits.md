Since I spend a lot of my time thinking about a PhD proposal, <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,911076,00.html" target="_top">this story</a> about British academia in today&#8217;s *Guardian* made me sit up:  


> Among the main findings of [an <a href="http://www.aut.org.uk/" target="_top">AUT</a>] survey revealed today, 26.9% of academics &#8212; representing nearly 43,000 individual staff members &#8212; said they were &#8220;fairly seriously&#8221; contemplating a career change, while 46% said morale had worsened in the past two years. On pay, 72% were dissatisfied, while 66% were unhappy with staffing levels in their area of work. The workload attracted a very negative response &#8212; 86% felt it was heavy, and 80% thought it had increased in the past two years. An overwhelming majority, 93%, said they suffered from workplace stress and 62% from &#8220;excessive&#8221; stress. On this issue, 81.7% said work impaired the quality of their life.</p>
Yay. Maybe I should reconsider. Or join the brain drain&#8212; <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=22067" target="_top">not that my ilk are faring any better</a> at **Yale.**
