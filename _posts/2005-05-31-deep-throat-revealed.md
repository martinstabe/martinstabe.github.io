**Bob Woodward** and **Carl Bernstein**&rsquo;s famous Watergate source, known only as Deep Throat, was **Mark Felt**.

The 91-year-old former deputy director of the FBI claimed that he was American journalism&rsquo;s most famous anonymous source in an [interview with *Vanity Fair*][1] magazine. The *Washington Post* <s>is [keeping schtum][2]</s> [has confirmed][3] that it is true. (And one of [its bloggers][4] has more).

Speculation about the identity of Deep Throat was last frenzied in February, when [**George Bush Sr.** was considered a candidate][5]. So much for that.
