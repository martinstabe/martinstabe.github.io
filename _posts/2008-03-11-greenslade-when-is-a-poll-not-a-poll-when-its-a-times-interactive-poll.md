I really like what the Times does online, but I must say that Roy Greenslade&#8217;s analysis of [today&#8217;s Times splash][1] is right on the money.

It doesn&#8217;t take university-level stats to know that [self-selecting samples cannot be extrapolated to populations][2]. An online vote touted as &#8220;a new kind of interactive poll&#8221; is no different than the sort of phone-in vote that papers have run for years.

It&#8217;s a very clever way of creating a very big collection of anecdotes, but to call it a &#8220;poll&#8221;, interactive or not, is misleading. 

My favourite bit (in the printed editon) was this: &#8220;The poll, which attracted 2,476 responses, is novel because it reflects not just hard statistical data, but people&#8217;s observations and anxieties about the state of the economy&#8221;.

Eh? &#8220;Hard statistical data&#8221;? Where? Methinks the &#8220;just&#8221; was superfluous.

Further down (in a tiny boxout at the foot of the jump on page 4) communities editor Tom Whitwell provides the disclaimer that should have been right up in paragraph two — the story &#8220;[does not have the statistical rigour][3] of an opinion poll&#8221;.

The Times [isn&#8217;t the first][4] newspaper to report its online votes as if they were some sort of survey, of course. But to sacrifice the intellectual rigour of a story for the sake of fostering online &#8220;community&#8221; or experimenting with &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; is a very strange set of journalistic priorities indeed. 

I wonder how many letters will flood in tomorrow from the Royal Statistical Society and various OxBridge dons.

[The obligatory Google Map is very pretty][5], though.
