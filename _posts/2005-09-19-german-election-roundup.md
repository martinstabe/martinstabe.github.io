A *Fistful of Euros* has the [preliminary final results][1] of the German election:

> With 299 out of 300 districts reporting, the SPD gained 34.3% of the vote, CDU/CSU 35.2%, the Greens 8.1%, the F.D.P. 9.8%, and the Linkspartei.PDS 8.7%. This led to the following final preliminary projection by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for the next Bundestag: 613 members (13 overhang seats, majority 307), 225 members for the CDU/CSU, 221 for the SPD, 61 for the F.D.P., 54 for the Linkspartei. PDS, 51 for the Greens

Some early views on the German election from the anglophone blogosphere:

*Poltical Betting* looks at [where the polls went wrong][2] in predicting an easy victory for the CDU. **Mike Smithson** says the result is a disaster for German pollsters &ldquo;on the scale of the 1992 UK General Election when the pollsters had it neck and neck but **John Major**&rsquo;s Tories came in 8% ahead in the popular vote.&rdquo;.

Or it could just be that the polls were right and this was just a huge personal disaster for **Angela Merkel**, who saw a 10 per cent poll lead evaporate during her campaign.

*A Fistful of Euros&rsquo;* **Tobias Schwartz** [joins the coalition speculation][3] and says the &ldquo;the vultures are already beginning to circle over Mrs Merkel&rdquo;. Some pretenders to the CDU throne might welcome a grand coalition under **Gerhard Schr&ouml;der** to run against in four years. **Mrs T** also thinks the biggest loser is Merkel who [presided over a worse result][4] than the Bavarian CSU premier **Edmund Stoiber** acheived for the conservative CDU/CSU bloc in 1992.

*Third Avenue* picks up on [the Dresden by-election angle][5] and notes that turnout was 79 per cent, &ldquo;a rather humbling percentage compared to the feeble UK effort last spring&rdquo;.

In the US, *Instapundit* provides the links needed to filter the German election [through an American Republican prism][6].

*MyDD* also sees the outcome as a [failure of the pollsters][7].

*Oxblog* has [a roundup][8], too.

**Update:** Official turnout was 77.7 per cent, but that hardly negates *Third Avenue&rsuo;s* point.
