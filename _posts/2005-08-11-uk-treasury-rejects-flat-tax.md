The Treasury has [rejected calls for introducing a &ldquo;flat tx&rdquo;][1] system in the UK, accourding to documents ([PDF][2]) obtained by the *Financial Times* [under the Freedom of Information Act][3].

Citing the experience of flat taxes in some Easter European countries, some Conservatives and the Adam Smith Institute think tank have been advocating the system, under which everyone pays the same rate of tax regardless of income. The Treasury, it seems, has not been persuaded by their arguements.
