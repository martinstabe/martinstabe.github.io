**Duncan Stephen** makes a very important point: [Joe Blogs and Joe Public are very different][1].

The range of political opinion emerging British blogosphere subculture is emphatically not representative of public opinion in this country: bloggers from left to right have a liberal (or libertarian) streak that leads to a broad oppositional consensus to things like ID cards and 90-day detention without charge. 

Not so the British public as a whole, which is much more sympathetic to the more populist and authoritarian view of the *Sun* and New Labour.
