The director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, **Maurice Frankel**, has an article today on [my new favourite web site][1] about [the first year of FOI in Britain][2]. He&rsquo;s fairly optimistic. But there&rsquo;s one issue of ptotential concern that has received surprisingly little media coverage: the government&rsquo;s apparent proposals to [introduce fees for information requests][3] &mdash; to combat time-wasting [frivolous requests][4].

> Significantly, nearly all the information provided under the act has been disclosed free of charge. Last year, **Lord Falconer**, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, succeeded in fighting off Whitehall pressure for heavy FoI charges. But a review of fees was promised after the act&rsquo;s first eight months and the issue is back on the agenda and being taken seriously.
> 
> When fees under the Irish FoI Act were sharply increased in 2003, the volume of requests collapsed to a quarter of the previous year&rsquo;s level. To put fees up now, before the act has taken root, would be a serious blow.

The *Daily Telegraph* takes up this issue today with a story about [voluntary organisations&rsquo; concerns][5] about the potentential introduction of request charges.
