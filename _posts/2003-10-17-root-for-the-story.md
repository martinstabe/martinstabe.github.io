A couple of years ago, I read an interview with a sports reporter &#8212; can&#8217;t remember who &#8212; on the topic of objectivity in sports journalism. How does one prevent being a &#8220;homer,&#8221; and reflecting support for the home team that you cover every day? &#8220;You root for the story,&#8221; he said. I hadn&#8217;t heard the cliche before, but it struck me as a good way of watching sporting events that you have no vested interst in. Which for me, being as a Mets fan, means most postseaon baseball games.

Apparently the baseball hacks weren&#8217;t rooting hard enough. In the centenary World Series, they could have had a showdown between baseball&#8217;s [two cursed teams][1] &#8212; the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. Boston hasn&#8217;t won a World Series since before they sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1919, and the Cubs haven&#8217;t won a Championship since 1908, or even been to one since 1945. Everyone, except for a [handful of contrarians][2] would have loved to watch Game 7 of that contest.

But it all went wrong in the League Championship Series. Instead of The Story, there will be a dull contest between the perenial contenders from the Bronx and the overacheiving Fish from Miami. But at least the collapse of the Cubs was a bit of a story. It even got a mention here in Britain, on the *Today* programme, no less ([RealAudio][3]).

Now I&#8217;m forced to deploy my other default baseball principles: &#8220;root for the underdog&#8221; and &#8220;anybody but the Yankees&#8221;. Go Fish!
