So much for German-American relations gradually healing. **Paul Wolfowitz** has written to the German newsmagazine *Der Spiegel* in response to [the interview][1] in which German foreign minister **Joschka Fischer** said that shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, Wolfowitz had intimated that in response to terrorism &#8220;the US had to liberate a whole string of countries from their terrorist rulers, if necessary by force.&#8221; 

Needless to say, Wolfie is not amused by that. He expressed disapointment that Fischer would publically repeat their private conversations and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,244560,00.html" target="_top">accused Fischer</a> of reproducing his statements inaccurately. For some reason, I doubt that. 

Oh yeah, and **Richard Perle** says &#8220;that the United States would be <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/93022.htm" target="_top">compelled to act</a> if it discovered that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction have been concealed in **Syria**.&#8221; Oh goody.
