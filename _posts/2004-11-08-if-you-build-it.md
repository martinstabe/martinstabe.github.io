London 2012 released some pictures of their [plans for the main Olympic venues in East London][2]. As a member of Britain&rsquo;s [tiny baseball community][3], I was excited to see the baseball diamond in the foreground. Having Olympic-calibre baseball diamonds built in London is the best thing that could happen to the dismal facilities available in this country.

Of course, all this depends not only on London being awarded the Games in the first place, but also baseball surviving on the Olympic programme beyond the 2008 Beijing games. With the [Baseball World Cup beginning in 2006][4], that seems less likely than ever.
