I see **Eszter Hargittai** is teaching [a class that will require her students to maintain a blog][1].

If I were still an undergraduate at Northwestern University, I would make sure to take [Sociology 376-23: Internet and Society][2]:

> The course is a social science course (half the students will be Communication Studies majors, half of them Sociology majors) with a focus on exploring the social, political, economic and cultural aspects of the Internet.
