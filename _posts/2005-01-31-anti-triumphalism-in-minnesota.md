**Atrios** points to a Minneapolis *Star-Tribune* [article][1] pointing out a dubious story on the conservative Minnesota-based blog *Powerline,* and [editorialises][2] with a statement that really ought to be self-evident by now. But there cannot be enough repetition of this point:

> &#8230; blogs are not &ldquo;self-correcting&rdquo; &mdash; you actually have to, you know, make corrections. And, especially if you operate a comment-free blog, your errors are not necessarily going to be pointed out to the rest of the world. And, more importantly, when you do stuff which is journalism-like, instead of pundit-like &mdash; that is, passing along information from sources, then there&rsquo;s a wee bit of obligation to try to verify that information.
> 
> Conservative bloggers engage in faith-based blogging. They say the &ldquo;blogosphere is self-correcting!&rdquo; and this absolves them from any responsibility to actually acknowledge or correct their errors. &#8230; 

I&#8217;m not sure this is really just a partisan question that applies to American conservatives &mdash; everybody believing the hype about the mystical powers of the blogging medium should bear this in mind.
