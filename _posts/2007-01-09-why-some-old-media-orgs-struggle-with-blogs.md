Alan Morrison has a great post that neatly [summarises][1] the common strand underlying the things [Andrew Grant-Adamson][2] ([repeatedly][3]) [Kevin Anderson][4], [Paul Bradshaw][5] [and I][6] (not to mention loads of other people) have been saying over the past few months about established media&#8217;s sometimes clumsy efforts at tacking social media &#8220;stuff&#8221; onto their existing publishing business:

> [D]on’t just bolt blogging or video onto your existing publishing model, because if you do you’re missing half of the point: contributing to these new media is a lot about having a conversation with their readers, NOT just megaphoning down to them, as per the traditional model.
> 
> That’s what differentiates Web 2.0 from the first wave – as the authors of *The Cluetrain Manifesto* say, it’s about having an interactive conversation with people in normal language, not the Big/Old Media “experts” talking down to the audience.
> 
> So why are smart people in established media brands making such clumsy “Dad dancing at the party”-type mistakes with their blogs? One word – paradigm. Mentally they’re still stuck in the industry paradigm (called it mindset or model if you want) that says this is the way to do things.

That&#8217;s about right. Kevin recently boiled it down even further: [&#8220;blogging isn&#8217;t a publishing strategy, it&#8217;s a community strategy&#8221;][7]. Robin Hamman elaborated with a long post explaining [what this means at the BBC][8].  
Of course, [not everyone][9] thinks having a conversation is a worthwhile objective for news organisations. In that case, don&#8217;t bother with [so-called &#8220;blogs&#8221;][10]. That&#8217;s OK, too. Your loss, but OK.
