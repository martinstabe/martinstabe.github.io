**Whittington**, the cat belonging to Lib Dem candidate **Susan Kramer**, [apparently has a blog][1]. 

I&rsquo;d be interested to hear Whittington&rsquo;s take on [**Humphrey**, the Downing Street Cat][2], whose &pound;100-a-year upkeep at taxpayers&rsquo;s expense was recently uncovered using the Freedom of Information Act. 

Also, do Liberal Democrat cats have a view on supporting research into [curing cat allergies][3]?

(Whittington gets a bit of help with blogging from **Jonathan Calder** of *[Liberal England][4].)*
