Iceland and Sweden have joined the growing list of [European countries that want to know whether the CIA used their airports during &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;][1] operations.  
[  
Denmark][2] has already closed its airspace to such flights. [Italy][3] and [Germany][4] are seeking CIA agents in connection with with the rendition of **Abu Omar**. In [Spain][5], police are investigating flights that landed in Mallorca.

[Norway][6] also has a criminal investigation underway and a German intelligence source told the *Herald* that [Austria][7] had on one occasion scambled fighters in intercept an unauthorised CIA flight.

Britain is increasingly isolated in Europe on the issue. The *Guardian* established that [British airports were used in CIA flights][8], and [police in Scotland are investigating][9], but the [UK government appears to have no problem][7] with Airstrip One being a hub for the alleged &ldquo;torture flights&rdquo;.

The European Commission wants to know more about the alleged [CIA &ldquo;black sites&rdquo; in Eastern Europe][10].
