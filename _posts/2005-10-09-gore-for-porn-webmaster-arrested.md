The man behind [a website that invited soldiers to post grisly photographs from the warzones][1] in Iraq and Afghanistan in exchange for access to pornography [has been arrested][2] in Florida.

**Chris Wilson**, who runs *Nowthatsfuckedup.com,* was charged with wholesale distribution of obscene material and a long list of misdemeanors related to individual items on his site.

The charges appear to stem from the sexual content of Wilson&rsquo;s site, which is hosted in Amsterdam &mdash; and [not the gory images][3] allegedly posted by soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
