A couple of months ago, I ranted about the tendency of the Sussex University Students&#8217; Union to censor ideas they don&#8217;t like by banning their sale at union-owned shops. A favourite target while I was a member of that organisation was the lad-mag *FHM,* which the Union deemed to be in violation of its equal-opportunities policy because of its portrayal of women. That&#8217;s left-wing student puritanism. But nobody does this better than good old conservative puritans. 

In the &#8220;American Pie&#8221; column in the <a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/" target="_top"><i>Press Gazette,</i></a> Britain&#8217;s trade publication for journalists, **Jeffrey Blyth** reported last week:  


> The decision by Wal-Mart &#8230; to ban the the sale of *Maxim,* as well as other lads&#8217; mags *Stuff* and *FHM,* has not overly fazed Dennis Publishing &#8230; The ban is not likely to have much effect on overall sales as Wal-Mart, big though it maybe, accouts for less than 3 per cent of news-stand sales of *Maxim* and the other magazines. It&#8217;s all part of a growing campaign, a log of it directed at records and CDs with racy lyrics, many of which have also been banned from Wal-Mart stores. Even magazines such as *Sports Illustrated* have been targeted. Last year&#8217;s annual swimsuit issues was removed from the racks because one single picture offended customers. &#8230;</p>
Last week, the *New York Times* carried a story on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/business/18MART.html?ex=1053835200&#038;en=e28255c89c31675f&#038;ei=5062&#038;partner=GOOGLE" target="_top">cultural power of the big-box retailers</a>. The *Times* story notes that **Eminem**&#8216;s latest album &#8212; ironically, a favourite target of British student unions as well &#8212; and **Kurt Cobain**&#8216;s dairies. Unlike student union shops, the decisions made by big-box retailers have the capacity to shape the market for cultural products</a>:  


> The big chains now often account for more than 50 percent of the sales of a best-selling compact disk, more than 40 percent for a best-selling book and more than 60 percent for a best-selling DVD, so publishers and the entertainment industry cannot ignore what they want. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> Several publishers said they had learned not to show books with explicit content or racy covers to the buyers for the mass merchandise chains, especially Wal-Mart. &#8220;Our reps who handle that channel might say, \`Well, that cover won&#8217;t get into Wal-Mart,&#8217; &#8221; and then we have to decide whether we are going to change it, if that is going to be a big channel for this book,&#8221; **Jane Friedman**, chief executive of the HarperCollins division of the News Corporation, said. &#8220;They have not dictated to us, but we are very smart about servicing that channel the way they would like to be serviced.&#8221; </blockquote>

> Unfortunatly, the issue isn&#8217;t as simple as some commentators, like the *Baltimore Sun&#8217;s* **Susan Reimer**, <a href="http://www.sunspot.net/features/bal-to.reimer13may13,0,3896494.column?coll=bal-features-headlines" target="_top">make it</a>. Wal-Mart is not an illegitimate self-appointed guardian of the First Amendment. Nor, is it, as **Diana West** of the * Washington Post* would <a href="http://www.jacksonvilleprogress.com/articles/2003/05/14/opinion/opinion01.txt" target="_top">have it</a>, a non-issue. &#8220;Just because Wal-Mart stopped selling Maxim et al. doesn&#8217;t mean the mags have disappeared down a hole,&#8221; she wrote. An <a href="http://ydr.com/story/opinion/9420/" target="_top">editorial</a> in the *York Daily Record* was the most honest. It was a business decision, and the attempt to spin it as moralistic is hypocritical:  
> 
> 
> > &#8230; the retail giant seems to have just bowed to pressure from its customers. Wal-Mart has read its own marketing studies and analyzed its demographics, figuring that God-fearing people don’t like what they see at the checkout line. There’s nothing wrong with bowing to customers. Business is all about knowing the customer.
