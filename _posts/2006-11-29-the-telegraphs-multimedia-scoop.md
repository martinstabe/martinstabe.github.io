At a Fleet Street pub full of journalists last night, someone mentioned seeing *Newsnight* on Monday night, when the front page of the next day&#8217;s *Daily Telegraph* was held out to the cameras as the first news of Michael Grade&#8217;s move from the BBC to ITV.  
Jeremy Paxmanâ€™s expression at the news that the Beeb had been scooped on an internal story by a print publication was, apparently, proof that even in the digital age, good old printed newspapers still set the daily news agenda.

*Telegraph* online editorial director Ed Roussel would [beg to differ][1], judging by his conversation with Jeff Jarvis.  
The *Telegraph* had broken the story online at 9:50, before Paxman went on air at 10:30 and long before the printed splash appeared on the &#8220;tomorrow&#8217;s headlines&#8221; segment at the end of the programme.

Newspaper brands may continue to set the agenda, but the English language really needs a word like *journal* or *Zeitung* that makes no mention of wood pulp in describing what multimedia news organisations do.
