I was just invited to join Friendster, the latest incarnation of the social networking web site genre. Yes, I know I&#8217;m a bit behind on the geek fads. 

Perhaps because of my vague interest in <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000438.html#000438" target="_top">social network analysis</a>, I accepted. <a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=515877" target="_top">My page</a> is only accessable if you&#8217;re in my network. If, like <a href="http://llareggolb.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_llareggolb_archive.html#200180182" target="_top">Michael O&#8217;Connor Clarke</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/001404.html" target="_top">David Weinberger</a>, I find the consequences of membership too uncomfortable, I will kill the account real quick.
