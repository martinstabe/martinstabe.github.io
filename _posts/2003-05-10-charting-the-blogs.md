The economist **Angry Bear** continues the theme of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_05_04_angrybear_archive.html#94073319" target="_top">graphically representing</a> the distribution of benefits of the Bush tax cut. The origin of this topic is the chart on page 3 of Rep. <b.Henry Waxman</b>&#8216;s report &#8220;The Dividend Tax Cut: Fortune 100 Corporate Executives Would Reap Huge Financial Benefits&#8221; (<a href="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs/pdf_inves/pdf_admin_dividend_tax_cut_executives_rep.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>). Incidentally, Rep. Waxman&#8217;s committee has produced another very interesting report, conveniently tabulating the estimated personal tax savings of the members of the Bush cabinet (<a href="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs/pdf_inves/pdf_admin_tax_plan_thomas_cabinet_analysis.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>). **Matthew Yglesias** <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/000398.html#000398" target="_top">points out</a> that the Waxman graph will not have the propaganda value others have hoped, because a huge number of Americans believe that they will one day be in the upper 1 percent that will benefit most. This reminds me of a **David Brooks** <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/opinion/12BROO.html?ex=1052712000&#038;en=a709bd5038a5c3ea&#038;ei=5070" target="_top">article</a> a few months ago, which explains why this sort of argumentation doesn&#8217;t work in the United States:  


> The most telling polling result from the 2000 election was from a Time magazine survey that asked people if they are in the top 1 percent of earners. Nineteen percent of Americans say they are in the richest 1 percent and a further 20 percent expect to be someday. So right away you have 39 percent of Americans who thought that when Mr. Gore savaged a plan that favored the top 1 percent, he was taking a direct shot at them.</p>
