There have been many examples in recent weeks of the [British media kowtowing to unofficial gag orders][1] from the political establishment.

Writing in the *Observer,* **Cristina Odone** describes this &ldquo;[very British game of collusion and cover-ups][2]&rdquo; perpetrated by the UK&rsquo;s media and political class:

> This system relies on the old boys&#8217; act rather than any law. Whenever the government feels the need to keep some piece of information secret, they send a note to editors asking for their co-operation in what is inevitably presented as a matter of national security. Editors comply, their journalists follow suit.
> 
> This sheds an unflattering light on all the players involved &mdash; from the government and police force that are equally obsessed with secrecy and obfuscation to a supine media pathetically grateful for any crumb of information tossed its way and any chance of being included at top table.

Britain&rsquo;s silly libel and contempt of court laws together with a tradition of administrative secrecy are all part of the &ldquo;culture of secrecy&rdquo; that journalists like to complain about. But what hope is there if the press itself is part of the conspiracy of silence?
