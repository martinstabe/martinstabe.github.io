It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here. The fact is, I&#8217;ve been rather busy [relaunching a web site][1], and sleep had to take priority over even more blogging.

My more usual home these days is the* Press Gazette&#8217;s* UK journalism blog, *[Blog Watches Dog][2].* The RSS feed is [here][3].

If you&#8217;re wondering about the odd title, it&#8217;s a reference to the *PG&#8217;s* old diary column, &#8220;Dog Watches Dog&#8221;. In the print edition, the popular canine was replaced last year by &#8220;[Axegrinder][4]&#8221; â€” but as a general rule, hacks can&#8217;t resist a poor pun.
