The *UK Press Gazette,* the journalists&#8217; trade magazine, is reporting that **Sidney Blumenthal** is a candidate for editior of a new *Guardian* magzine for the American market. The *Press Gazette* isn&#8217;t online free, but here&#8217;s [the story][1] from the New York *Daily News*. The *New York Observer* also mentioned it is [a story][2] about the influence of British journalism on American war reporting. 

One unrelated paragraph in that story caught my attention:  


> &#8230; English journalists seem happy being ink-stained wretches &#8212; alienated, underpaid, free to speak their minds. On this score, American journalists have been somewhat corrupted. Many of them are now top-tier socially and rich, to boot. A freelancer can dream of being a celebrity, of becoming famous and making money on TV. Respect and sycophancy ease the way; asking impertinent questions does not.</p>
Yup.
