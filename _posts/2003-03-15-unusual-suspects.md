From the <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/15/BA105060.DTL" target="_top">San Francisco Chronicle</a>:  


> Police arrested 80 protesters, including a former president of the Pacific Exchange, during nonviolent protests &#8230; Friday in San Francisco&#8217;s Financial District. 
> 
> [...] The star of the day, however, was former Pacific Exchange president **Warren Langley.** 
> 
> &#8220;People ask me who I&#8217;m representing,&#8221; Langley said. &#8220;I&#8217;m representing the establishment. And there are a lot of other people out there who feel like I do. Now is the time to take the next step in speaking your conscience.&#8221;

> [...]This was the first protest for the 1965 graduate of the Air Force Academy, and the retired lieutenant colonel couldn&#8217;t eat anything for breakfast. &#8230;</blockquote>
