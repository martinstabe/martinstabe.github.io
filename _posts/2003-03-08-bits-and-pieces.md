After some reflection, I&#8217;ve decided not to post my rant about the nonsense that 24-year-old *Independent *columnist **Johann Hari** wrote yesterday about our &#8220;generation.&#8221; Hari thinks we&#8217;re all <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=384638" target="_top">Ketamine-popping cynics</a> who have nothing nice to say about politicians and only root for &#8220;sneerers&#8221; like **Jeremy Paxman**. Whatever. Zzzz. 

I&#8217;ll wait a few weeks till I start making enemies with this blog. Instead some other stuff: 

In case you missed it, *Ha&#8217;aretz* reporter **Amira Hass,** the the first and only Israeli journalist living in the Palestinian territories, yesterday <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=270094&#038;contrassID=1&#038;subContrassID=7&#038;sbSubContrassID=0&#038;listSrc=Y" target="_top"> won the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize</a>. 

In the *New Yorker,* **Simon Schama** does his best to widen the alleged transatlantic rift with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030310fa_fact" target="_top">this piece,</a> while at Oxford, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2003/03/green-s-03-06.html" target="_top">Seth Green</a> is the member of <a href="http://www.americansforinformeddemocracy.com/" target="_top">a group trying to close it</a>. I got that via **Matthew Yglesias, **whose post on this topic has provoked some [interesting comments][1] on the effect of 24-hour news on the transatlantic relationship. 

Lately I have been wondering whether I should have bothered going to university at all. Now it&#8217;s official: <a href="http://education.independent.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=384572" target="_top">I&#8217;d be better off if I hadn&#8217;t</a>.
