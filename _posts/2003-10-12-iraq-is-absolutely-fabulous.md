Looks like someone has organised a rather crude PR operation in support of the US operation in Iraq. A number of American regional newspapers have [recieved identical letters][1], purportedly from local GIs stationed in liberated Iraq, saying everything there is wonderful. At least one soldier, Pfc. Nick Deaconson, didn&#8217;t even know his name was being used in this way.
