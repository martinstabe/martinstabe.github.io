Josh Bancroft [has noticed][1] that there is a user on Twitter with the username [CNN Breaking News][2].

It certainly looks like <strike>the news channel</strike> someone is experimenting with using the mobile social networking tool to break news headlines.

Twitter is certainly a clever technology combining blogging, text messaging and social networking. The site allows users to post 160-character posts that can be delivered to their network of friends and assorted online stalkers via SMS or AOL Instant Messenger.

It can be a fun way to keep in touch with many friends simultaniously. Over the holiday period, my phone was bombarded by Twitters sent by food blogger [Graham Holliday][3] detailing his [gluttony over the holidays][4], 160 characters at a time.  
So far, that&#8217;s how I have been using it — as a toy. But <strike>CNN&#8217;s</strike> this experiment suggests that it has potential as a platform for more serious applications for journalists like delivering news and obtaining instant feedback from readers&#8217; mobile phones.

I may eventually work out how to use Twitter to deliver short news items. For now, you can subscribe to my feed of odd random text messages from me by [adding me as a friend][5] on Twitter.

**Update:** In the comments, Bobbie Johnson points out that we may be dealing with a mashup of sorts. Credit is apparently owed to [James Cox][6], and not anybody in Atlanta. It&#8217;s a great idea whoever is doing it — I hope more useful applications like this will be created for Twitter.

**Update2:** [Cox explains his mashup][7] elsewhere.[
