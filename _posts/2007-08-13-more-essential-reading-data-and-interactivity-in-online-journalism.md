A post published last week on the *Newspaper Next* blog is going straight to the [list of essential online journalism blog posts][1].

Steve Buttry looks at how [presenting local information databases online][2] can help newspapers &#8220;become the source for answers&#8221;. There are loads of great examples of how US newspapers presenting public records in an easily-accessible form for their readers.

Making existing databases available and useful to readers is just one side of the data coin, though. What about the opposite possibility: enlisting readers&#8217; help to generate the data that will form the basis of new reporting?

Jeff Jarvis has a suggestion for [a networked journalism project][3] about local infrastructure. Jarvis suggests how things like the [*Bakersfield Californian&#8217;s* pothole map][4] or MySociety&#8217;s [FixmyStreet][5] to the next level.

Once readers have identified potential trouble spots, Jarvis says, &#8220;do what you do best: add journalism.&#8221;

Someone has already [acted on the suggestion][6].

Incidentally, these issues are good example of some of the other items of the essential reading list. The Newspaper Next post is a collection of data projects that [turn the web into the canvas for computer-assisted reporting][7], as Derek Willis put it. They are also good examples of Ryan Sholin&#8217;s [online journalism skills trinity][8] â€” they are examples at the intersection of &#8220;data&#8221; and &#8220;interactivity&#8221;. Now if only we could find some way to add the third component, &#8220;multimedia&#8221;. Angela Grant has [some contributions for that section][9] of the reading list.
