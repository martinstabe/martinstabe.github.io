Here&rsquo;s a shock: journalists and non-media types in the United States have [very divergent views on press freedom][1], bias and journalists&rsquo; rights.

One of the more intersting (and positive, in my humble opinion) findings of a study by the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Annenberg Public Policy Center is that that Americans as a whole are far less dissaproving of partisan bias in journalism than American journalists are. Perhaps the ideology of phoney &ldquo;objectivity&rdquo; is breaking down.
