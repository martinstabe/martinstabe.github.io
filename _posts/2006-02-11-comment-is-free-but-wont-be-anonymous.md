The [*Guardian* will soon be launching *Comment is Free*][1] &mdash; a new commentry blog modelled on the *Huffington Post.* 

In his column today, assistant editor **Neil Macintosh** revealed that in an effort to avoid the kind of uncivil behaviour that recently forced the *Washington Post* to [shut its blogs&rsquo;s comments sections][2], the *Guardian* site will require readers to register with a valid e-mail address before being allowed to comment.

But that&rsquo;s not the only feature they may be implementing to [promote accountability][3]:

> We are also thinking of revealing on the site every commenter&rsquo;s rough geographical location; information not exposed to the public before. Experiments on other sites suggest debates are more civil when everyone knows where everyone else is.

Interesting. 

**Update:** One site that already uses geolocation in this way is Topix.net.

In [an interview][4] for PBS *MediaShift,* Topix.net chief executive **Rich Skrenta** told **Mark Glaser**:

> The geolocation technology we use is 99% accurate on a country level, 80% accurate on a state level, and 75% accurate for U.S. cities. Often for a wrong city it still gets the right “neck of the woods” for a poster. It says I’m in San Francisco when I’m actually in Palo Alto. It is finding the location of the poster’s ISP, not the poster themselves, which can be surprising. 

Assuming the *Guardian* is playing with similar geolocation tools &mdash; which are being used increasingly by advertisers and are availble on simple web statistics tools like Google Analytics and even Sitemeter &mdash; I suspect *Comment is Free* will find a huge contingent of commenters from Lambeth, were, judging from the geolocation feature in my own logs, many London ISPs seem to be based.

**Update 2:** See also **Simon Waldman** on [the legal risks the *Guardian* is taking][5] by letting commenters post directly to their web site.
