Deep inside the *Guardian* Education section today is [the tale][1] of how **Graham Barnfield**, a [journalism lecturer][2] at the University of East London, became an expert on &ldquo;happy slapping&rdquo; because a succession of journalists and PRs around the world failed to check their facts.

After a heavily-edited interview with him appeared on *Tonight with Trevor McDonald,* Barnfield says he was misquoted in an article on the BBC web site ([this one, perhaps?][3]) about &ldquo;happy slapping&rdquo;, allegedly saying that TV violence was to blame. From there 

> Within a week, Barnfield had drifted into a surreal world. Not only were his views being misquoted in the British, New Zealand, South African, German and Indian media without a single journalist bothering to check for accuracy, he was also being misrepresented as an expert on happy slapping, a title he had never claimed for himself.

> &#8230;Although Barnfield had never suggested a causal link between TV and happy slapping, the press release sent out the night before the *[Tonight]* programme was shown on May 12 claimed he had, and it was on this that the BBC and other media based their stories.

There&#8217;s a lesson in there for both journalists and bloggers, but I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it&#8230;

**Update:** [Barnfield&rsquo;s version of events][4] is on *Spiked.* His blog, the *[Loneliest Jukebox][5],* has more details about his 15 minutes of fame.
