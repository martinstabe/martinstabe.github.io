Google appears to have [lost its German domain name][1] to a cybersquatter after forgetting to renew the registration for [google.de][2].

The page now directs you to a holding page at Goneo, a web hosting company. The domain&#8217;s WHOIS entry [now reads][3]:

> `[Holder]<br />
Type:         ORG<br />
Name:         favo<br />
[...]<br />
Country:      DE<br />
Remarks:      ID #8616<br />
Changed:      2004-10-27T10:45:06+02:00`

Favo&#8217;s website describes it as a company specialising in registering recently-expired domains. The company&#8217;s administrative contact — like Google.de&#8217;s right now — is one Mario Micklisch of Wiesbaden.

As *Wortfeld* reported, it&#8217;s fairly common for big online property owners to forget about their domains. Microsoft once had the same thing happen to [Hotmail.co.uk][4], and [WashingtonPost.com][5] also got lost once.

<strike>**Update:** Something else is going on as well. As user [Atari][6] is pointing out in comments all over the place, German web-based WHOIS tool Serversniff.de (and [other WHOIS lookups based in Germany][7]) show some unusual results for Google.com:</strike>

> <strike>Server Name: GOOGLE.COM.ZZZZZ.GET.LAID.AT.WWW.SWINGINGCOMMUNITY.COM  
> IP Address: 69.41.185.195  
> Registrar: INNERWISE, INC. D/B/A ITSYOURDOMAIN.COM  
> Whois Server: whois.itsyourdomain.com  
> Referral URL: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.itsyourdomain.com/">http://www.itsyourdomain.com</a></strike>
> 
> <strike>Server Name: GOOGLE.COM.ZOMBIED.AND.HACKED.BY.WWW.WEB-HACK.COM  
> IP Address: 217.107.217.167  
> Registrar: ONLINENIC, INC.  
> Whois Server: whois.OnlineNIC.com  
> Referral URL: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlinenic.com/">http://www.OnlineNIC.com</a></strike>
> 
> <strike>etc&#8230;</strike>

<strike>English-language WHOIS tools, however, show Google owned by a Mountain View, California, corporation of the same name. Whatever is going on seems to be localised to Germany for the moment.</strike>

**Update:** Google.de seems to be pointing at Google again.

**Update:** See also *[SearchEngineLand][8], [Google Blogscoped][9].*
