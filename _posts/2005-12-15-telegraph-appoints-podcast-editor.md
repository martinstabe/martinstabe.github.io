The *Daily Telegraph* has [appointed a Podcast Editor][1].

**Guy Ruddle** starts the post at the helm of the [*Telegraph&rsquo;s* Podcast][2] in January &mdash; just as [&ldquo;podcast&rdquo; enters the *New Oxford American Dictionary*][3]. He previously presented the BBC Radio 5 business programme *Wake up to Money.*

As if we needed any more proof, the boundary between print and broadcast journalism is becoming fuzzy online.

The editor of the *Guardian&rsquo;s* web site, **Emily Bell**, recently told the *Press Gazette* that she sees [no reason why the *Guardian* should&rsquo;t also broadcast video][4] on its web site as broadband speeds increase.

The *Guardian&rsquo;s* **Ricky Gervais** podcast is currently [topping charts][5] in both the US and UK.
