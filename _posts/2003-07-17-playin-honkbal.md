I got back from Amsterdam late last night. I had been watching a couple of games of the [European Baseball Championships][1]. 

On Tuesday afternoon, I watched Great Britain &mdash; a team that includes six of my Brighton teammates &mdash; beat Germany, 5-3. That evening, we all went over to Haarlem to watch the Netherlands clobber Sweden before a crowd of about 4,500. 

The *International Herald Tribune* published a [lengthy story about the tournament][2]. **John Vinocur**&#8216;s piece is the best journalism about European baseball I have seen. His name-dropping of two top European clubs &mdash; Germany&rsquo;s [Paderborn][3] and France&rsquo;s [Savigny-sur-Orge][4] &mdash; proves that he&#8217;s done his homework. 

After the Holland-Sweden game, we bumped into Netherlands manager **Davey Johnson** outside the stadium, and took some pictures of him with my teammates. I&#8217;m still don&#8217;t have a digital camera, so it will be a while before they get posted here. The *IHT* story had a [sidebar about Johnson][5]. An AP reporter also filed a story about Johnson, which the *New York Times,* among others, [picked up][6].
