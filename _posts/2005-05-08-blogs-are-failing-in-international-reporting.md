Another day, another bit of blog pessimism from yours truly.

I&rsquo;ve just posted a story I wrote about the [scarcity of news coming out of Turkmenistan][1] (one one of the scariest countries in the world) &mdash; and how the evidence shows that the blogosphere is doing a pretty lousy job of reporting foreign news.

Right on cue, one of my sources for the story, **Ethan Zuckerman** of Harvard Law School&rsquo;s [Berkman Center for Internet & Society][2], has put up [a post][3] about his research into how bloggers selectively amplify stories from various countries:

> Given bloggers&rsquo; tendency to report on developing nations less than mainstream news sources, and the NY Times/Blogpulse comparisons using Iraq as a baseline, I&rsquo;m tempted to conclude that bloggers reported on the AlertNet 10 under-reported stories no more frequently than mainstream papers. But it looks like bloggers seized the tsunami issue with passion, mentioning the tsunami, tsunami relief concerts and aid efforts to a greater degree than mainstream news sources.

And I&rsquo;m tempted to conclude that the blogosphere is even worse at looking beyond the backyard than mainstream journalism. And that is saying a lot.
