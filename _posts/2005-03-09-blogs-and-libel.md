Another day, another essential post from **Dan Gillmor**. This time, he explains [bloggers&rsquo; and libel law][1], by pointing out *BusinessWeek&rsquo;s* mistaken notion that bloggers are somehow immune by pointing out an [old but important post][2] by Yale law professor **Jack Balkin**.

Combined with the [*OJR* article][3] Gillmor also links to and this [handy guide][4] by **Brian Carroll** of the UNC School of Journalism & Mass Communications just about covers the still-confused position in the United States. [[ADDED 10.1.2006][5]]
