The photos were [leaked to ABC News][1], allegedly by sources in [US law enforcement][2] agencies with whom British police shared the evidence. 

Despite a [plea from the police][3] last night not to publish the photos, a number of national newspapers &mdash; broadsheet and tabloid &mdash; carried them on their front pages.

It [wasn&rsquo;t the only recent leak][4] of British materials in the United States. According to the BBC,

> Soon after the bombings a Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre report leaked to the *New York Times* revealed that three weeks before the attacks British intelligence officials thought there was no group with the intent or capacity to attack the UK.

Now CNN that Met Commissioner Sir **Ian Blair** is [concerned that the leak came from US agencies][5]:

> &ldquo;I am concerned that some of the photos were supplied in confidence to some of our colleague agencies in the U.S. and were published there and subsequently around the world,&rdquo; Blair said.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> In the U.S., leading Congressman **Pete Hoekstra** said the leak could affect the relationship between intelligence agencies in Britain and the U.S.
> 
> Hoekstra, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said: &ldquo;We work on this stuff hand in hand and we can&rsquo;t be looking over each other&rsquo;s shoulder wondering who is leaking whose information.
> 
> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to know how tight police are being with the details in London but if the investigation is put in jeopardy, that would be a tragedy.&rdquo;

In the age of the internet, asking people not to publish material already readily available in another jurisdiction is a futile excercise.

[ABC did ignore the police request][6] not to publish, but can perhaps be forgiven because publishing material from an ongoing investigation isn&rsquo;t as big a problem in the US as it is in more Britain.

But what was the leaker(s) thinking? What interest is served by putting these images in the public domain? Am I missing something here?

**Update:** Via *Liberal England,* I learn that [foreign media with foreign law enforcement sources have been beating their British counterparts][7] since the very day of the bombings.
