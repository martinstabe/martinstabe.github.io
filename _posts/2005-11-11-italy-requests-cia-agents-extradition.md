Italian prosecutors have [requested the extradition of 22 CIA agents][1] they suspect of involvement of kidnapping a radical Islamic preacher three years ago.

**Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr**, an Egyptian native known as **Abu Omar** was a member of the radical Muslim group Jamaat al-Islamiya, but had been granted political asylum in Italy.

Abu Omar was under surviellance by Italian police, but suddenly disappeared on 17 February 2003, apparently due to [an &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo; operation][2] in which the CIA transported him back to Egypt, where he remains in prison and claims to have been tortured.
