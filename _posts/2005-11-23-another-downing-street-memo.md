Ho hum. [Nothing to see here][1]:

> &#8230; **Lord Goldsmith**, the Attorney-General, informed newspapers editors including that of *The Times* that &ldquo;publication of a document that has been unlawfully disclosed by a Crown servant could be in breach of Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act.&rdquo;
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> Under a front-page headline &ldquo;[Bush plot to bomb his ally][2]&rdquo; in the *Daily Mirror* yesterday, a secret minute of the conversation in April 2004 records the President allegedly suggesting that he would like to bomb the channel&rsquo;s studios in Doha, capital of Qatar. &#8230;
> 
> According to the *Mirror,* the transcript turned up in the office of former Labour MP **Tony Clarke**, who lost his Northampton South seat in May.

And guess what, [two people have already been charged under the Official Secrets Act][3] for leaking the document:

> Last week, **Leo O&rsquo;Connor**, a former researcher for Mr Clarke, was charged with receiving a document under section 5 of the act. **David Keogh**, a former Foreign Office official seconded to the Cabinet Office, was charged last week with making a &ldquo;damaging disclosure of a document relating to international relations&rdquo;. Mr Keogh, 49, is accused of sending the document to Mr O&rsquo;Connor, 42, between April 16 and May 28 2004.

And CNN has [the official denial][4]:

> &ldquo;We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response,&rdquo; a White House official told CNN. A Pentagon official called the *Daily Mirror* report &ldquo;absolutely absurd.&rdquo;
> 
> Al-Jazeera said it wanted to be &ldquo;absolutely sure&rdquo; the memo cited in the report is genuine and urged 10 Downing Street to confirm the information if true.
> 
> If the memo is accurate, the network&rsquo;s statement said, &ldquo;it would be incumbent on them to explain their positions on statements regarding the deliberate targeting of journalists and news organizations.&rdquo;
> 
> Downing Street spokesman **Ian Gleeson** said Blair&rsquo;s office would have no comment since the memo the *Daily Mirror* cited is the subject of court action.

It seems the contents of the document are &ldquo;outlandish&rdquo; enough to warrnet a very public prosecution a civil servant and a Parliamentary aide for leaking it.
