Don&rsquo;t believe [the hype][1]. [Only six per cent of Americans read blogs][2], according to a [new study][3] by Forrester Research.

**Update:** Thanks to Robin for pointing out a discrepancy: The *Boston Herald* account I have linked to above says that just two percent read blogs. The original Forrester press release, however, says six per cent read blogs, with two percent using RSS.
