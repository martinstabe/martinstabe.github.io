Amy Gahran at the Poynter Institute says [&#8220;computer-assisted reporting&#8221; (CAR) is an anachronistic term][1]:

> &#8230; No one makes a big deal about &#8220;telephone-assisted reporting.&#8221; Is the term &ldquo;computer-assisted reporting&rdquo; (CAR) getting to that point? &#8230;

> CAR used to be all the rage. But nowadays, I doubt there&#8217;s much reporting that isn&#8217;t &ldquo;computer assisted&rdquo; in one way or another &mdash; from Google and DexOnline to campaign finance databases. More specific terms, like &ldquo;data mining,&rdquo; appear to be in ascendance from what I hear. What are you hearing?

[I agree][2]. This is even more true in those rare cases when reporters do statistical analysis. Tell me what statistical tests you used, not that you used a computer. That&rsquo;s just obvious.
