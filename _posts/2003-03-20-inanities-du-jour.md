Watch this space for today&#8217;s non-war-related signs that all is not well in the world. 

  * **Monica Lewinsky** will be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57515-2003Mar19.html" target="_top">hosting a reality show</a> on&#8230; you guessed it: Fox. Nah, TV isn&#8217;t dumbing down.
  * According to the Associated Press, medical schools have abandoned &#8220;a little-known, decades-old practice&#8221; of letting students perform <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Mar/03202003/thursday/39837.asp" target="_top">nonconsensual pelvic exams</a> on women who are under anesthesia. Lovely.
  * Well, I guess one war-related story belongs in this category. **Optimus Prime** <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_03_16_atrios_archive.html#200018374" target="_top">goes to war.</a> No, not a Transformer; he is a member of the Ohio National Guard.
