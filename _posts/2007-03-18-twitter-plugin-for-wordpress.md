I have just installed Victoria Chan&#8217;s [Twitter Updater][1] WordPress plugin , [as fixed by James Cridland][2]. Thank you to both for this excellent tool.

If you [add me][3] to your Twitter friends, you will receive an update by instant messenger or SMS every time I post something to this blog or update something that&#8217;s already here. I&#8217;d appreciate any feedback on whether this is useful or how it could be improved.

<s>There is a WordPress plugin that updates Twitter when you post something new to a blog. This is my first attempt to use it. If all goes well, I will update this post with more details. If it goes pairshaped, this post will self-destruct in five seconds.

Update: Wot, no TinyURL?</s>

Update2: <s>Ah, that&#8217;s better.</s> Apologies to all whose mobile phones I may be sending haywire right now.
