The IHT notices that [the data theft scandals that have plagued the United States ths year are strangely absent in Europe][1]:

> &#8230; data theft is not a major problem in Britain, Germany or France. One reason may be that European countries have a comprehensive set of national privacy laws and an office of data protection, led by a privacy commissioner. The United States, by contrast, has a patchwork of state and federal laws and various agencies responsible for data protection.

The flip side, of this, is that there is far less government information available here in Europe:

> In general, Americans are far more comfortable than Europeans with businesses&#8217; handling their information and far more skeptical of putting it in government hands. The tradition of making government records &mdash; like tax records, mortgage information and census data &mdash; easily accessible to the public is uniquely American.
> 
> This has helped create the world&rsquo;s largest data-collection industry by far.

> 
> &ldquo;In Europe, there is much less use of data warehousing and data mining because the culture has not been friendly to it,&rdquo; said **Alan Westin**, director of Privacy Exchange, an advocacy group sponsored by the consumer data industry. &ldquo;No company in France, Germany or the U.K. has that kind of data-mining capability, because they don&rsquo;t have the public record and census data&rdquo; that American companies have.
> 
> Restrictions on the commercial use of private data also have meant that data-mining interest groups never became entrenched in Europe.
