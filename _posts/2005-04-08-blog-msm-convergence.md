**Nosemonkey**, posting at the excellent new group blog about the [2005 UK General Election][1], has more about[ how British political campaigns are using new media][2].

One interesting development is how the major news outlets are turning to blogs or blog-like web sites to cover the election:

> &#8230; the fact that even media behemoths the BBC and *The Times* are cottoning on to blogging as a cheap way of publishing should be an indication that the British use of the interweb is a very different one to that of America, where most blogs are genuinely trying to uncover the distortions of the press (often while creating their own).

Perhaps British political blogging with not have the anti-establishmentarian bent of its American cousin.
