The *Chicago Tribune&#8217;s* interactive division is hoping to [hire a journalist specialising in interactive database production][1] of the sort Adrian Holovaty [has been advocating][2].

The [requirements for the job][3] are pretty demanding:

  * 2-5 years’ experience with databases, preferably in a newsroom
  * Bachelor’s degree in journalism, English or related discipline
  * Computer-assisted reporting background or similar
  * Demonstrated knowledge of statistics, statistical analysis, etc.
  * Strong oral and written communication skills
  * Experience in database content entry and management
  * Broad experience with data sources, data mining and database  
    concepting
  * Familiarity with database interfaces and web presentation layers
  * Basic knowledge of HTML and Flash required; advanced skills  
    desirable

A journalism or English graduate with quantitative and technical skills to go with a deep understanding of how the web works. There aren&#8217;t many people with that skillset.

What&#8217;s worse, I can&#8217;t imagine how anyone would obtain those skills through conventional journalism education.

I can&#8217;t think of any journalism course in Britain that prepares students for a career path that might eventually involve applying for a job like this — although I&#8217;d love to be corrected if I&#8217;m wrong.

**Update 9/3:** There has been a lot of activity on this topic since I posted this. Adrian [Holovaty is hiring][4] at WashingtonPost.com, while Matt Waite counsels newspapers stop looking for the next Holovaty and to [concentrate on finding these skills among existing staff][5]. Meanwhile, Mark Glaser of MediaShift has [a great report][6] on what various other US newspapers are doing in this area.
