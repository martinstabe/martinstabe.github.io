[Robb Montgomery][1] has left [a great comment][2] on a post over at Andy Dickinson&#8217;s place:

> The typical newspaper newsroom traditionally has been undercapitalized and stuffed with crummy old computers.
> 
> These are the questions I ask news executives.
> 
>   * Is your IT department under editorial control? Why not?
>   * Has you boss ever blogged?, or hand-coded anything in HTML?
>   * Have they ever posted a photo on Flickr, mixed multi-track audio or edited news video?
>   * Does it feel like your paper’s IT department has turned off the most vital parts of the internet and are filtering your access as digital reporters and editors?
> 
> **How are you going to transform into multi-platform news operations if you are a journalist working in a newsroom that can’t even use the internet as well as your readers and users can at their home?**

I&#8217;m not sure the MD needs to know HTML or use Flickr, but beyond that, the words &#8216;nail&#8217;, &#8216;hit&#8217; and &#8216;head&#8217; spring to mind.
