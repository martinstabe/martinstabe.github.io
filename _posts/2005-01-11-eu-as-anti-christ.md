Recently, [*The Periscope*][1] and [*Lose the Delusion*][2], and [*Demystifying&#8230;*][3] have been amused by the view among some American Christian fundimentalists that the EU is the anti-Christ.

But EU-as-Beast rhetoric is not a particularly new phenomenon, nor is it confined to North America. In fact, its origin may be within the EU. [Digging through my archive][4], I found a 2003 **Harry Farrell** [post][5] about the views of Rev. **Ian Paisley** MEP on this matter.
