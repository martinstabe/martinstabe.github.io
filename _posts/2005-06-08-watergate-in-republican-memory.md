The idea, prominant among American conservatives, that the media is dangerously liberal and biased against them, has become common in recent years &mdash; particularly in the blogosphere &mdash; but it stems at least from the era of **Richard Nixon**.

The revelation of Deep Throat&rsquo;s identity has brought some of these issues back to national attention, and the *Los Angeles Times* has an article about how the [attitudes of some of the members of the Bush administration towards the media were shaped by their experiences under Nixon][1]:

> Today, an arm&#8217;s-length relationship with the press, a highly controlled message and a restrictive interpretation of public records laws are the norm at the Bush White House.
> 
> Defense Secretary **Donald H. Rumsfeld**, a Nixon aide who also served as chief of staff to **Ford**, tried to stop Congress&rsquo; post-Watergate broadening of the Freedom of Information Act. The act requires the government to disclose certain records to citizens.
> 
> Working with **Cheney**, Rumsfeld persuaded Ford to veto the legislation, according to [declassified documents][2] obtained last year by the [National Security Archive][3] at Georgetown University. Congress overrode Ford&rsquo;s veto.
