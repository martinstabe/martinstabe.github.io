*Mystery Pollster* **Mark Blumenthal** [links to][1] Gallup&rsquo;s report on the [survey about blogging][2] that it produced for CNN and *USA Today.*

When CNN reported the poll last week, their angle was that the data shows that [blogging remains a fringe phenomenon][3]. For a medium used to thinking of success in terms of huge raw readership figures, this is undoubtedly true. But that, Blumenthal says, is missing the point:

> &#8230; The 12% that say they read political blogs at least a few times a month amount to roughly 26 million Americans. That may not make blogs a &#8220;dominant&#8221; news source, but one American in ten ads up to a lot of influence.

What is also interesting is that the demographics of the political blog readership is almost a mirror image of traditional media consumers: 

> Gallup finds Americans&rsquo; use of all traditional news media to be positively correlated with age. (For instance, only 32% of 18- to 29-year-olds read a local paper every day, versus 61% of those 65 and older)

Moreover, the overall size of that readership may be less important that the fact that it includes an elite readership of media types, as **Matthew Yglesias** [noted][4] a few days ago in a reply to [*New Donkey&rsquo;s* take on the same poll][5]:

> &#8230; This thing of ours is a good way of trying to influence elite opinion and maybe alter the media climate, but it&rsquo;s an enormous mistake to confuse it with anything like a viable basis for a mass political movement. &#8230;

Meanwhile, **Dan Drezner** [points out a new research][6] ([PDF][7]) by **Lada Adamic** and **Natalie Glance** that examined linking patterns of liberal and conservative American blogs during the presidential election. **Kevin Drum** has an excellent [summary of the conclusions][8].

Now, all of this is about the situation in the United States. With a general election looming, I wish we had some comparable data for Britain or Europe so that we could better assess whether or not British blogging is a [pointless waste of time][9].
