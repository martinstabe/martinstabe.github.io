The *Washington Post* has an article about the [use of credit card data][1] to label customers as abusers of returns policies. The article provides another refutation of the &ldquo;the innocent have nothing to fear&#8221; argument for increased data surviellance:

> As the holiday shopping season gets into full swing, a number of major retailers &mdash; including KB Toys and Sports Authority, according to store personnel &mdash; are rolling out electronic systems that weigh the number of returns and exchanges a person has made, the dollar value of the items, and the dates of the transactions to decide whether a consumer should be granted another. The systems are designed to catch shoplifters and those who &ldquo;wardrobe,&rdquo; wearing clothes and then returning them for a full refund.
> 
> But Salerno, 26, a receptionist at a Manhattan financial firm, said she falls under neither category. She returns things often because she buys things often. She said she feels she has done nothing wrong &mdash; the clothes were never worn and the tags were still attached &mdash; but that she was treated like a criminal.
