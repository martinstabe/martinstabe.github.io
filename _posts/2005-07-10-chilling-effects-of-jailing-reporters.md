The jailing of **Judith Miller** of the *New York Times* and last-minute reprieve for *Time* magazine&rsquo;s **Matthew Cooper** is already showing signes of having major implications for the freedom of the press in the United States.

The Cleveland *Plain Dealer* is [sitting on two stories based on leaked documents][1] because they don&rsquo;t want to expose their reporters to the same dilemna of chosing between burning a source and going to jail.

Meanwhile, *Newsweek&rsquo;s* **Michael Isikoff** (he of the Lewinskygate and the Qu&rsquo;aran-in-toiletgate) is reporting that [**Karl Rove** was the source that Cooper was protecting][2].

For British audiences not familiar with the chast of characters in Washington journalism, **Peter Preston** the *Observer* [neatly translates the whole soap opera][3] into Westminsterese:

> Even my American friends &mdash; though wholly supportive of the *New York Times&rsquo;s* **Judith Miller** and her stalwart refusal to name her sources, even from a prison cell &#8211; get a bit perplexed on the details. Isn&#8217;t this the same Judith Miller who set off a US-wide drive against using anonymous sources last year, because her source on Iraq WMDs in the build-up to war turned out to be **Ahmed Chalabi**? And doesn&#8217;t everyone assume that one of the guys she&#8217;s protecting is **Karl Rove**, **George Bush**&rsquo;s own prince of darkness?
> 
> It&rsquo;s rather like **Andrew Gilligan** choosing to spend six months in Brixton to defend a source called **Alastair Campbell**. The principle is magnificent, as long as you don&rsquo;t try to explain it.

**Update:** The *Christian Science Monitor&rsquo;s* story on [Miller&rsquo;s jailing][4] assesses the potential consequences:

> It is not reporters but sources themselves whose behavior may change the most, says one expert. Having seen the limits of their legal protection, potential whistle-blowers could become more reluctant to pick up the phone and make, or take, a media call.

And [**Jay Rosen** is spot on][5]: **Robert Novak**, the rightwing columnist who (unlike Miller) actually named **Valerie Plame** as a CIA operative in print should be the reporter on the receiving end of all those chilling effects.
