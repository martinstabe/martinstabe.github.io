There&rsquo;s not much I can add to **Brad DeLong**&rsquo;s [summary][1] of a recent *GQ* article by **Wil Hylton**:

> &#8230; To do a profile of **Alan Greenspan** without an &ldquo;in-depth discussion of policy issues&rdquo; as as *stupid* an enterprise as doing a profile of **Martha Stewart** without mentioning that she does interior design or doing a profile of **Gwyneth Paltrow** without mentioning that she acts in movies.
