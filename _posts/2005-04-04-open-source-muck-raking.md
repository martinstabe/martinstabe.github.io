Looks like a new 900-pound gorilla is about to join the left side of the American blogosphere. 

**Josh Marshall** of *Talking Points Memo* fame is about to launch a new six-member group blog as part of a bigger web site with ambitions at organising his considerable readership into [open source muck-rakers][1]: 

> Another reason for launching the site is &#8230; the way that blogs can facilitate what amounts to a sort of distributed or open-source journalism. Perhaps, you might even call it open-source muck-raking. 
> 
> &#8230; It would have been impossible for me, for instance, to have written most of what I&#8217;ve written on Social Security over the last few months if I didn&rsquo;t have literally thousands of people reading their local papers and letting me know what they&rsquo;re seeing or reporting back from townhall meetings or giving me the heads up on things that are about to break on the hill. That&rsquo;s not a replacement for journalism; it&rsquo;s different. But it&rsquo;s potentially very powerful.
