One of the odder results from the German election was that both party leaders will have [namesakes on the other side of the aisle][1].

**Petra-Evelyne Merkel** held the Berlin constituency Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf for **Gerhard Schr&ouml;der**&rsquo;s Social Democrats while **Ole Schr&ouml;der** picked up Pinneberg in Schleswig-Holstein for **Angela Merkel**&rsquo;s Christian Democrats.
