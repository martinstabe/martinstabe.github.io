The blogosphere might be [lagging in Britain][1] [and Germany][2], but [perhaps France and Poland may be Europe&rsquo;s great blogging hope][3]. 

In an i[nterview with *Journalism.co.uk*][4] last week, **Guillaume Champeau** of French citizen media site AgoraVox said:

> The numbers speak for themselves: as of June 2005 there were about 6 million blogs in Europe, with 3 million of them being French! The highest blogging population behind France was the Polish (1,300,000), and there were only 900,000 British bloggers at that time.

I&rsquo;m not sure what the source of his numbers is, because some other estimates suggest [there may be up to 2.5 million British blogs][5]. But it&rsquo;s certainly plausible.

*AgoraVox* is [planning to launch an English-language version][6].
