One of the favourite clich&eacute;s of British tabloid headline writers is the &ldquo;Fury At *x&rdquo;* construction.

The subjectless and verbless sentence fragment conveniently leaves the question of agency &mdash; whose fury? &mdash; open to the fertile imagination of the reader. And of course, that&rsquo;s the point. Nobody other than the newspaper itself is actually furious, but it allows reporting of a non-existing conflict as if it were a straight news story.

So, in the interests of media literacy, here&rsquo;s *Straight Banana&rsquo;s* [take on this silliness][1]:

> Not for the first time, as I flicked through the *Mail&rsquo;s* pages, I observed today how so much of the reactionary press&rsquo;s bread and butter reporting is based on &rsquo;manufactured fury&rsquo;. You can spot it a mile off. The headline screams about some terrible controversy, and within the first few sentences the reader has learned that there is general &#8220;outrage&#8221; / &#8220;fury&#8221; / &#8220;anger&#8221; at such-and-such a government proposal or political manoeuvre. Who&rsquo;s the fount of all this negative emotion? Well, we never quite find out. As the story continues, the reporter constructs a careful account of just why we should be angry, but the original claim &mdash; that someone, somewhere already is &mdash; is never justified.

> I suppose the idea is to get the article off the ground by pretending that there&#8217;s a legitimate news story in the first place. Of course, &#8220;The Mail thinks X is bad&#8221; is not news; but FURY AT X is. It&rsquo;s handy: it commits the newspaper editor to no particular empirical proposition, but it does provide a springboard for him to further his political agenda by disguising opinion as fact.

Look for the subject in any tabloid sentence whenever you see the word &ldquo;fury&rdquo;. Usually, some conflict actually exists, but is buried somewhere in graf five. But sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. In that case, you are reading a non-story.

Same applies for &ldquo;row&rdquo;. And when you see that nice short abbreviation &ldquo;EU&rdquo;, make sure you check which institution the story is about. [Sometimes they are not EU institutions at all][2].
