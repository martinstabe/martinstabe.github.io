I tend to regard text-to-speech features on news web sites as something of a gimmick.

Earlier this week, I wrote a very brief item about a [&#8220;virtual newsreader&#8221;][1] being on the web site of the *[Welwyn and Hatfield Times][2],* a weekly local paper published by Archant. I thought of it as a pretty offbeat story rather than some important innovation, and picked the funniest available quote to use.

But now my story is being [passed around][3] on a site called *BlindNews,* reminding me that there are important applications for text-to-speech technology. The little animated newsreader avatar is still superfluous, though.
