The *FT* today has a story about research by a Cass Business School professor who questions [the high cost of footballers&rsquo; transfer fees makes financial sense][1] to Premiership clubs.

**[Gilad Livne][2]** argues that new accounting rules mean that football managers will have to disclose all transfer fess on their clubs&rsquo; balance sheets. His research into 58 clubs shows that high transfer fee players &ldquo;might not enhance profitability or cash flow&rdquo;.

Of course, football fans would argue that their club&rsquo;s share price isn&rsqou;t, shall we say, the most pressing dependent variable. Victories in a season, perhaps, would be a better indication of whether that big signing was value for money.

The excellent *JunkCharts* blog, which tracks dodgy visualisations of statistics in the news, [notices][3] just this kind of story, albeit about [about the baseball clubs&rsquo;s payrolls][4], in the *New York Times.* This one has the advantage of using the only dependent variable that anyone reading the sports page will care about.

But *Junk Charts* points out that the *Times* gets the statistics wrong: &ldquo there appears to be a general association between payroll and winningness&rdquo;.

It would be interesting to see the same thing done for the Premiership. If Livne Livne is right, the requisite dataset of transfer fees may soon become available.
