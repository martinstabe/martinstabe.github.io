BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s [*PM* programme][1] had an item about whether blogging is going to &ldquo;change the world&rdquo;

The item centred on a discussion of the **Eason Jordan** case, and included an interview **Rony Abovitz** whose [post][2] on the World Economic Forum weblog sparked the story.

City University journalism professor **[Stewart Purvis][3]** argued that &ldquo;what is giving the energy to the blogosphere is a resentment of the old media&rdquo;, particularly the view on the American right that American journalists are too left-wing.

Purvis also suggested that blogging threatens journalists&rsquo; traditional view of themselves as the gatekeepers of information that enters public discourse.

By the end of the programme, somebody had [e-mailed][4] the programme saying they looked forward to bloggers &ldquo;challenging the left-wing hegemony at the BBC&rdquo;. 

Um&#8230; Doesn&#8217;t [somebody][5] claim to be doing that already?
