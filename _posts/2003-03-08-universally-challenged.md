Whenever some new problem arises in the British university system, the first place some people look for a panacea is the United States. Not always a good idea. In light of the **Bristol University** admissions row, [the leader in the *Independent*][1] calls for something akin to the American **Scholastic Aptitude Test** (SAT) as an alternative university selection mechanism for British colleges. This is a really, really bad idea. Clearly the *Indy* hasn&#8217;t heard that the SAT is controversial in the United States for exacerbating precisely in the problem that they hope it would solve in Britain. As the leader notes,

> Universities that are serious about broadening their entry ought to try using a test of aptitude like the American SATs to supplement A-levels and select candidates for interviews.Of course, any selection mechanism will be colonised by the activist middle classes keen to gain an edge for their children.

Exactly. The U.S. (upper-) middle class has created a vast industry of test-preparation programmes to give their kids an edge on the SAT and similar tests. And they have been remarkably successful. As **Nicholas Lemann** argues in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374527512/texasn1-21" target="_top"><i>The Big Test,</i></a> the SAT was designed to be a neutral, meritocratic selection device (albeit laced with some eugenic thinking). Today, there are major [positive correlations between parental income and SAT scores.][2] Not to mention the disadvantages to non-white and female students that have been statistically demonstrated. And the lack of any correlation between SAT scores and performance in tertiary education.
