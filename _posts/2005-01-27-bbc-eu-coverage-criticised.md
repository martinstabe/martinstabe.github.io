The independent panel commissioned by BBC board of governors has issued its report; it found no bias, but found the quality [BBC&rsquo;s coverage of the EU wanting][1]:

> It said BBC impartiality had been undermined by &ldquo;an institutional mindset, a tendency to polarise and over-simplify issues, a measure of ignorance of the European Union on the part of some journalists and a failure to report issues that ought to be reported, perhaps out of a belief they are not sufficiently entertaining&rdquo;.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> UK officials at the European Parliament also condemned aspects of BBC coverage. In a submission, **Dermot Scott**, director of the parliament&rsquo;s UK office, said the BBC &ldquo;reinforced ignorance&rdquo; by presenting arguments as if the main issues were about Britain&rsquo;s membership of the EU or single currency.

The [full report][2] is available online.

**Update:** As pointed out in the comments, *Straight Banana* has an [excellent post on this topic][3].
