It&rsquo;s been a while since I&#8217;ve endulged my esoteric interest in international baseball on this blog, so here goes: the members of the [Chinese national team][1] are preparing for the 2008 Olympics. As the hosts, China will automatically qualify. Although I&#8217;m generally sceptical of the London 2012 bid, securing automatic qualification for the [Great Britain National Baseball Team][2] would be a certain bonus. [[ADDED 13.1.2006][3]]
