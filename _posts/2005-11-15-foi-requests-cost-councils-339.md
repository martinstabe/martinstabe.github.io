Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is [costing local authorities &pound;339 per request][1], a survey by the Constitution Unit at University College London has found ([PDF][2]).

The report also found that councils in England received 35,406 requests in the first six months since FOIA came into force on 1 January at a cost of about &pound;12 million.
