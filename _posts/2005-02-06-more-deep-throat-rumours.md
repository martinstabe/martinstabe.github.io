According to a [column][1] in the *LA Times* by **John Dean** [noted][2] by *TheCorrection.org,* we may soon know who Deep Throat is:

> **Bob Woodward** &#8230; has advised his executive editor at the *Washington Post* that Throat is ill. And **Ben Bradlee**, former executive editor of the *Post* and one of the few people to whom Woodward confided his source&rsquo;s identity, has publicly acknowledged that he has written Throat&rsquo;s obituary.

On a completly pedantic aside &mdash; What&rsquo;s with &rdquo;Throat&ldquo; on second reference? That&rsquo;s taking the style book a tad seriously, no? Does that mean it would it be &ldquo;Mr Throat&rdquo; in some publications?
