<a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_03_23_atrios_archive.html#200054709" target="_top"><b>Atrios</b></a> points out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/jan-june03/cols_3-26.html" target="_top">this quote</a> from PBS&#8217; *Newshour*. Asked if the public would know if the war went wrong, Air Force operations planner **Sam Gardiner** said:  


> No. I just want to add a political military dimension. Yesterday a very important thing happened. Two retired four-star generals: **Wes Clark** and **Barry McCaffrey**, who was a division commander in the first Gulf War, said we don&#8217;t have enough force. Whether they are right or not, the leadership of the United States has a problem. And that is if we go to Baghdad with two divisions and there are losses, that&#8217;s regime change kind of stuff. And I don&#8217;t mean Baghdad regime change. But you don&#8217;t send American men and women into battle without all it takes to do that. I mean, that&#8217;s a very serious thing.</p>
