The arrested suspects alleged to be the failed London suicide bombers [might not be able to get a fair trial in Britain][1] because of the media&rsquo;s reporting of their arrests, *Press Gazette* reported this week.

In an open letter the human rights group Liberty urged the atterney general, **Lord Goldsmith**, to remind the media of the contempt of court laws. They are particularly concerned about the reporting of an alleged confession by Osman Hussain, the suspect arrested in Italy. These reports were apparently based on a leak from Italian law enforcement sources (letter, [PDF][2]).

As I understand it, there is no seperate media law for bloggers, so everything being said about newspapers here also applies to us.
