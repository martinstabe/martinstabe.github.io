It seems my suspicions about the media coverage of the **Jessica Lynch** story were justified. BBC correspondent **John Kampfner** says the rescue was &#8220;one of the most stunning pieces of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/correspondent/3028585.stm" target="_top">news management</a> ever conceived.&#8221; 

**Update:** One of <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001247.html" target="_top">CalPundit</a>&#8216;s comments on this points out that the *Toronto Star* had <a href="http://www.thestar.ca/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&#038;c=Article&#038;cid=1051643375850&#038;call_page=TS_News&#038;call_pageid=968332188492&#038;call_pagepath=News/News" target="_top">this story</a> a few weeks ago.
