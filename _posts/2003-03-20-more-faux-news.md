The *New York Times* <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/20/international/worldspecial/20WATC.html" target="_top">calls it</a> an illustration of the &#8220;danger&#8221; of &#8220;rumors going unchecked&#8221; when professional journalists leave the war zone. I call it the worst francophobic slander yet:  


> On Tuesday, **Oliver L. North,** who was in Kuwait with the First Marine Expeditionary Force, told Fox News over a videophone that he had heard &#8220;rumors&#8221; that French Embassy officials in Baghdad were helping to destroy evidence of French cooperation with **Saddam Hussein&#8217;s** stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. 
> 
> &#8220;That is more than inaccurate or untrue,&#8221; said **Nathalie Loiseau,** the spokeswoman for the French Embassy in Washington. &#8220;It is insulting.&#8221; Ms. Loiseau said the entire French delegation left Baghdad on Tuesday morning.
