[Russia will not renew the press accreditation][1] of journalists working for ABC, after the Moscow correspondent of the American television network conducted an interview with Chechian warlord **Shamil Basayev**.

The move means that ABC reporters can forget about asking questions to Russian government sources. Russian journalist **[Andrei Babitsky][2]**, who conducted the interview for *Nightline,* [could face prosecution][3].

Basayev, who has claimed responsibility for the Beslan school hostage-taking, is public enemy number one in Russia and has $10 million bounty on his head. The Russian government said the ABC report had offered &ldquo;a platform to a blood thirsty terrorist&rdquo; and was &ldquo;supporting the propaganda of terrorism&rdquo;.

According to Reporters Without Borders, the Russian Foreign Ministry issed a press release saying that &ldquo;ABC is *persona non grata* as far as any contact with an official Russian organization is concerned&rdquo.

It couldn&rsquo;t have helped that the reporter in question was Andrei Babitsky, who has long been a [thorn in the Kremlin&rsquo; side][4]. In 2000, while he was working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Babitsky was [detained by Russian authorities][5] after reporting on Chechnya.
