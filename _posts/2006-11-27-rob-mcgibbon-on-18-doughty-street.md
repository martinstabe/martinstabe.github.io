[Rob McGibbon][1], who wrote *Press Gazette&#8217;s* [&#8220;Press Conference&#8221; celebrity interviews][2], will be on [18 Doughty Street][3] [with Iain Dale][4] tonight at 9pm.

Also appearing on the *Vox Politix* programme will be blogger Justin &#8220;[Chicken Yoghurt][5]&#8221; McKeating, who was also [once a *PG* contributor][6]. That should be worth watching.
