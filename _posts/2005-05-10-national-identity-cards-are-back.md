The UK government&#8217;s national identity card project was rudely interupted by the general election.

No so in the United States, where a bill that would mandate federal minimum standards for state Identity documents &mdash; creating a [*de facto* national ID card][1] &mdash; has been quietly [winding its way through Congress][2].

The Senate is due to vote on the Real ID Act today, and [opposition is gathering][3] on the Net.

**Update:** Security expert **Bruce Schneier** [weighs in][4] with some arguements that opponants of the UK ID card scheme might find interesting, too.
