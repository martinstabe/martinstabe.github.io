The *Financial Times* [story about Black Wednesday][1] that has been causing all the fuss about the Freedom of Information Act finally came out today. [Sterling withdrawl from European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992][2] cost the British taxpayer &pound;3.3 billion.

It sure didn&rsquo;t take long for politicians to start running scared of Britain&rsquo;s new disclosure law. Tonight the *Evening Standard* [reports][3] that the Freedom of Information Act may be amended:

> Constitutional Affairs Secretary **Lord Falconer** said he wanted former ministers to be given new rights to appeal against documents released under the Act.
> 
> Former prime minister **John Major** also called for reform today, but urged that economic forecasts currently held secret by the Treasury should be made more open to the public. Lord Falconer&mdash;admitted that he was worried&mdash;that the Act was being used as a &ldquo;political football&rdquo; in the run-up to the general election.
> 
> He revealed he has written to Opposition Leader **Michael Howard** for consensus on reforms.

I&#8217;m not sure why using the FOIA as a &ldquo;political football&rdquo; is such a bad thing, as everybody seems to think these days.

The point of Freedom of Information is improved accountability, and if political parties &mdash; associations of politically-engaged citizens &mdash; want to hold their rivals to account over their past or current failures in government, this seems like a perfectly reasonable application of the law. Why this sort of use of the act should cease during *elections* is beyond me.
