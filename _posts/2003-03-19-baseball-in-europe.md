The <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030320wo51.htm" target="_top">game in Japan</a> may be cancelled, but Major League Baseball is still eager to build a bigger overseas profile, even here in baseball-parched Europe. On Monday, the Associated Press reported that a plan is afoot to play some games of the 2004 season <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-mlb-europe" target="_top">in Europe</a>.The gist:  


> The commissioner&#8217;s office has started discussing a plan to move regular-season games to Europe in July 2004. 
> 
> Italy, France, the Netherlands and England are among the candidates, according to **Paul Archey,** a senior vice president of Major League Baseball International. 
> 
> [...] Planning for Europe is in the early stages. Commissioner **Bud Selig** has not yet given the go-ahead, although he&#8217;s excited about the possibilities of taking the game all over the world. 
> 
> [...]&#8220;Italy is probably the front-runner because they have one of the strongest fan bases and they have facilities,&#8221;&#8217; Archey said.</blockquote> 
> 
> Better yet, the **New York Mets** have <a href="http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/104805906328000.xml" target="_top">expressed interest</a> in the venture. Obviously, I&#8217;m biased in favour of England, but there&#8217;s always Ryanair if they go somewhere else. 
> 
> Meanwhile, details of the [more significant European baseball plan][1] have quietly been sitting on the web site of the French Baseball, Softball and Cricket Federation for months. I wonder how long it will take for someone to finally pick it up.
