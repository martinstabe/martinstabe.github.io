Are mainstream journalists finally waking up to the potential of new technologies in their line of work? I nearly spewed my coffee yesterday morning when I read [this line][1] about **David Krane**, Google&rsquo;s director of public relations, in the *New York Times:*

> In an instant-message interview, Mr. Krane said, &ldquo;You can put us down for a &lsquo;no comment.&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Instant-message interview&rdquo;? I like it. I wonder how common this is in the American newsrooms. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll experiment by setting up a [Google news alert RSS feed][2] for that phrase.

**Update:** *CJR Daily* was [impressed by the irony][3] of the phrase. I don&rsquo;t get it. What&rsquo;s ironic about it?
