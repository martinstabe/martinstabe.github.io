Writing in the German journal *Internationale Politik,* EU Industry Commissioner **G&uuml;nter Verheugen**, indicated that he could imagine a [closer economic relationship between the EU and Israel][1], even including Israeli membership in the euro.

According to [a report][2] in Austria&rsquo;s *Die Presse,* the EU accounts for 33 percent of Israel&#8217;s trade, ahead of the United States at 28.6 percent. Israel already has a free-trade agreement with the EU, and polls have indicated 80 percent of Israelis would like their country to be a member of the EU. 

Verheugen, who was previously Commissioner for Enlargement, is a [advocate of closer ties with Israel][3].
