There&#8217;s not much EU news in the UK media today.

All the broadsheets, plus the *Daily Mail*, mention the revelation in the European Parliament by UKIP MEP **Nigel Farage** that the new transport commissioner, **Jacques Barrot**, had been convicted in a case involving the misuse of the funds of the French CDS party, of which he was secretary general at the time.

Commission President **Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso** was not aware of the issue until Thursday, and because Barrot was pardoned in a general amnesty passed by the French Assembly, making it illegal to mention the case in the French media.

UKIP leader **Nigel Farage** in exposing the story. The *Guardian* explains that [Farage &ldquo;might face legal action despite his parliamentary immunity][1], because Mr Barrot&#8217;s lawyer, **Jean-Pierre Mignard**, said any public reference to a conviction under the French amnesty laws was illegal.&rdquo;

The *Mail* has Farage&rsquo;s reaction: 

> The European Parliament is prepared to overlook the conviction of a senior member of the Commission for embezzling government funds, and is prepared instead to threaten with arrest the person who reveals it. 
> 
> What clearer indication can there possibly be of the corruption and hypocrisy which pervades the entire European project from the lowest to the highest levels?

The *Daily Telegraph* quotes one leading MEP as saying of Barrot: &ldquo;[the issue of resignation is on the table][2].&rdquo;

The *Independent* has a comment piece by Dutch foreign minister **Bernard Bot** defending [ Europe&#8217;s stance on terrorism][3] against charges of complacency:

> If there are Americans who think Europeans are complacent about the terror threat, then let me set the record straight. Hundreds of Europeans have died in terrorist attacks &mdash; on and after 11 September. Just because many Europeans prefer to speak of a &#8220;campaign&#8221; rather than a &#8220;war&#8221; against terrorism does not mean they believe there is nothing to fight for.

The article touches on European states&#8217; efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, the Balkans, Sudan, Congo, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Eritrea and the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The *Daily Telegraph* also reports that the new Commissioner for External Affairs, **Benita Ferrero-Waldner**, believes the [EU should have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council][4]. Ferrero-Waldner said that an EU seat would not have to come at the expense of Britain&rsquo;s and France&rsquo;s seats.
