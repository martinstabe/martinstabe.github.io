The *Independent* is reporting that the [BBC has fresh evidence][1] for its side of the story in the row with **Alastair Campbell** and the **Blair** government:  


> **Andrew Gilligan**, the BBC reporter who has been the focus of government attacks, will produce further information on how the intelligence services were supposedly pressured by Mr Campbell about the &#8220;45-minute threats&#8221; posed by **Saddam Hussein**, which appeared in the first Downing Street dossier last September. 
> 
> An investigation is under way, allegedly at the behest of Number 10, to hunt down Gilligan&#8217;s source. 
> 
> Mr Gilligan, the defence and diplomatic correspondent of [Radio 4&#8242;s *Today* programme][2], has told **Richard Sambrook**, the head of news at the BBC, the identity of his informant. **Greg Dyke**, the director general, has been given details of the source but not his name. 
> 
> Sources within the intelligence services have indicated that they will be &#8220;combative&#8221; if the Government attempts to start a witch-hunt to find out those responsible for leaks to a number of journalists about the unhappiness within the services over how intelligence on Iraq was manipulated. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> Mr Gilligan, with the backing of the BBC, has announced that he is ready to sue **Phil Woolas**, the deputy leader of the House of Commons, over the allegation that he misled the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. &#8230; </blockquote> 
> 
> Oh, yay! This is getting ever more fun. I hope *Today* gets into more sneering fights with government ministers, the way they did on Friday with **Ben Bradshaw** ([RealAudio][3]). That will really get me out of bed!
