American jounralists are currently celebrating the first national [Sunshine Week][1], a [series of events][2] celebrating Freedom of Information laws, which are often called &#8220;sunshine laws&#8221; at the state level, particularly in Florida, which some of the best open government laws in the United States.

The project is an outgrowth of [Sunshine Sunday][3], which has been held for four years in Florida. On Sunshine Sunday, American newspapers ran articles and editorial leaders assessing the condition of their states&rsquo; respective Freedom of Information laws. [Bloggers were encouraged to join in][4], too.

It&rsquo;s a particularly important time for bloggers. In Washington Senators **John Cornyn** and **Patrick Leahy** are leading efforts to expand Freedom of Information laws through the [OPEN Government Act][5], which would expand the exemption from fees that is currently only available to journalists with an institutional affiliation.

Of course, the Federal FOIA dates to 1966 and [has been a model for countries all over the world][6]. Here in Britain, implementation for the [FOIA 2000][7] dates to, um, 2005.

How is it working out so far? Well, the new FOIA is brilliant if you want to know all about things like [Humphrey, the Downing Street cat][8] or [aliens from outer space][9]. 

But the details of expenses claimed of the members of the Scottish Parliament? [Unlikely][10]. How about getting hold of your son&rsquo;s medical records after he died while in a military barracks? [Nope][11]. Or to find out what advice the Government got from its senior legal advisor before going to war in Iraq? [Fuggeddaboudit][12] &mdash; [at least till after the election][13].

To be fair, you can also get details of slightly more worthy things like [previous Governments&rsquo;s missteps][14], the [number of parking tickets][15] issued in a Birmingham suburb.

If, like the *Sunday Express* you make use of Canada&rsquo;s FOIA, you can also learn about the the levels of [asbestos found in former Royal Navy submarines][16]. 

Or you could run a story about MoD plans to discredit **John Large**, a scientist about to blow the whistle on the safety of subs&rsquo;. In the MoD documents that **Mark Howarth** of the *Sunday Express* Scottish edition cites is this passage:

> &ldquo;Probably best to burn this email before the Freedom of Information Act kicks in.&rdquo;

And all those are your British FOIA stories for Blogshine Sunday 2005.
