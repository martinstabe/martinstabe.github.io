I&#8217;m glad somebody noticed over there. Congrats to **Mark Leon Goldberg** at Tapped for being one of a tiny number of US bloggers to notice that the British [&ldquo;functional equivalent of attorney general and director of homeland security&rdquo; resigned today][1]. His post is a good summary for the uninitiated.
