> Ditto for &#8220;french toast,&#8221; which will be known as &#8220;freedom toast.&#8221; 
> 
> The name changes were spearheaded by two Republican lawmakers who held a news conference Tuesday to make the name changes official on the menus.

> 
> Another young man agreed. (*Merci,* [Ezra Klein][2].)
