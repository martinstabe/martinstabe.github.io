Fine. So you want to rename french fries? At least use the opportunity to <a href="http://www.belgianfries.com/" target="_top">get it right</a>. 

In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/weekinreview/16BOXB.html" target="_top">beautifully ironic development</a>, Democrats seeking to ridicule Rep. **Bob Ney,** (who instigated the &#8220;freedom fries&#8221; name-change) have discovered that the Ohio Republican may actually be a descendent of **Marshal Ney,** who was one of **Napoleon&#8217;s** generals. 

**Update:** Now that open season on all things Gallic has also declared even here in Britain, <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2003_03_09.html#000064" target="_top">this entry</a> on **Unfogged** deserves attention.
