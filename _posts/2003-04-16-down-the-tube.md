**Jonathan Davis** has found a <a href="http://www.ukpoliticsmisc.org.uk/weblog/archive/2003_04_13_old.php#200150085" target="_top">geographically-accurate map</a> of the London Underground to compare with the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/1576494545/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00005W&#038;topic_id=1&#038;topic=" target="_top">more familiar diagram</a>. Very interesting &#8230; if you spend as much of your life on the Piccadilly Line, as I do. 

**Update:** There are <a href="http://www.sitehouse.net/cdl/maps.html" target="_top">historical tube maps</a> here. Right&#8230; Enough trainspotting for <s>today</s> this year.
