[Via *Europhobia*][1] I see that with a little [help from the Guardian&rsquo;s web site][2], the online edition of the *[The Zimbabwean][3]* is now available.

To find out more about the [internet-based free press in Zimbabwe][4] and *The Zimbabwean&rsquo;s* remarkable editor, [**Wilf Mbanga**][5], check out the stories by **Blessing Ruzengwe** over at *Metrovox.*

**Update:** Blessing Ruzengwe also has a story about the [crackdown on internet caf&eacute;s][6] in the *Zimbabwean* itself.
