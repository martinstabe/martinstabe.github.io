Online news was supposed to lead to &#8220;The Daily Me&#8221;, hyper-personalised publications where the homepage is magically tailored to each user&#8217;s interests. But with a handful of notable exceptions &#8211; particularly [certain mobile sites][1] &#8211; few news sites have implemented personalisation features in any significant way.

[TheMediaBriefing][2], the new media news aggregator edited by my friend and former Press Gazette colleague [Patrick Smith][3], is showing everyone else how simple it could be.

The site [uses semantic tagging technology][4] to (re-)categorise media news from dozens of sources. Each category created by this tagging process generates generates an index page, like this one for (my new employer) the [Financial Times][5].

With one click, logged-in uses can chose to &#8220;follow&#8221; those categories that they are interested in. This generates a personalised homepage, called &#8220;[My Tracker][6]&#8221; that merges all the their &#8220;followed&#8221; categories.

The interface is familiar to anyone who has used Facebook&#8217;s Like buttons to add friends and topics to their news feed. It uses the existing category structure of the site, so it&#8217;s the sort of thing any news site could implement. It&#8217;s a surprise so few news sites do anything similar. 

The only other similar feature I&#8217;m aware of is on The Sporting News, which allows users to [follow individual categories on Facebook using Facebook Like buttons][7], and has claimed [massive success in driving traffic][8] from this. Are there any other examples out there?
