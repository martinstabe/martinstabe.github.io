According to the BBC, even Switzerland has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2868127.stm" target="_top">expressing a view</a> on the war:  


> Switzerland banned all military exports to countries engaged in the war against Iraq. A spokesman said it would break the country&#8217;s neutrality rules to do so, because the war had not been sanctioned by the UN.</p>
In fact, Switzerland has <a href="http://www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&#038;sid=1708835" target="_top">maintained its neutrality</a>, but the export ban is very real. 

Exports of Swiss military material amounted to $216 million last year, with the United States and Britain were among the top five importers. 

Swiss president **Pascal Couchepin** said he &#8220;regretted&#8221; the military action against Iraq and also announced that his country was banning military, surveillance and reconnaissance flights over its airspace by the United States and its coalition.
