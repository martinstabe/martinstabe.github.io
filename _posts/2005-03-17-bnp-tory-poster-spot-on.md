A campaign newspaper distributed in Maidenhead by the far-right British National Party says a Conservative Party election poster about immigration is &ldquo;spot on&rdquo;.

The item, in the March 2005 edition of BNP&rsquo;s vile *Voice of Freedom* rag, quotes a BNP spokesman disowning a Conservative Party poster with the slogan &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not racist to impose limits of immigration&rdquo;. The fascist flack goes on to say, however, that the message of the poster is &ldquo;spot on and has helped promote the debate on immigration that this country urgently needs.&rdquo;

The poster had allegedly been photographed after &ldquo;a wag&rdquo; had pasted a BNP logo over the Conservative Party logo on it. (Or perhaps it was Photoshopped.)

When the poster was first released a few weeks ago, the Conservative Party denied that they were [appealing to the same instincts][1] as the BNP.

A picture of the BNP paper&rsquo;s story is below the fold. Having handled this filth, I must now go disinfect my hands.
