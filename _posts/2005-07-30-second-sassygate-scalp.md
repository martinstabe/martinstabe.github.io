Today, the [*New Orleans Times-Picayune* profiles **Scott Burgess**][1], the American ex-pat blogger who yesterday took credit for a second scalp at the *Guardian* in the **Dilpazier Aslam** story.

Burgess [claims][2] to have two sources that say **Albert Scardino**, the *Guardian&rsquo;s* executive editor who has [left the paper][3] &ldquo;to pursue a variety of news and entertainment projects,&rdquo; actually resigned over the hiring of Aslam.

According to the *Guardian* report, Scardino was responsible for &ldquo;training and career development&rdquo; at the paper. *Harry&rsquo;s Place,* the other blog heavily involved in the story, reported that Scardino had been responsible for hiring Aslam and had [suggested that Aslam write the &ldquo;sassy&rdquo; comment piece][4] that started the whole controversy.

According to the *Times,* however, the *Guardian* was &ldquo;at pains to point out that the departure was [entirely unconnected with the Aslam affair][5].&rdquo;

> &#8230; *Guardian* sources today were stressing that while Mr Scardino &ldquo;was very loosely responsible&rdquo; for recruitment issues, he had not interviewed Mr Aslam and had not involved &ldquo;in any way&rdquo; in the decision to grant him a place on the diversity scheme.

If the issues truly turn out to be somehow related, this is a much more significant development than Aslam&rsquo;s initial dismissal. This would be the first senior UK journalist to feel the wrath of the blogosphere. Scardino, an American, is no mere trainee hack. He&rsquo;s a Pulizer Prize winner ([Editorial Writing, 1984][6]) whose CV includes a stint with the *New York Times* and as press officer for former New York mayor **David Dinkins**. Oh, and he happens to be married to Dame **[Marjorie Morris Scardino][7]**, the CEO of *Financial Times* publishers Pearson and one of the [most powerful women in the world][8] (or at least the [the media][9]).

**Update:** Lest conservative bloggers&rsquo;s triumphalism drowns out any alternaive views on this, you should go read **Yusef Smith**&rsquo;s take on the [false and libellous][10] reporting in the blogosphere on this matter. At the *Sharpener,* he also provides an [alternative view][11] of the story, which he says has been tainted by prejudice, inaccuracy and hypocrisy.
