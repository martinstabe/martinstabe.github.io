Yikes!

The AP [reports][1]:

> &#8230; when told of the exact text of the First Amendment, more than one in three high school students said it goes &ldquo;too far&rdquo; in the rights it guarantees. Only half of the students said newspapers should be allowed to publish freely without government approval of stories.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> The students are even more restrictive in their views than their elders, the study says.
> 
> When asked whether people should be allowed to express unpopular views, 97 percent of teachers and 99 percent of school principals said yes. Only 83 percent of students did.
