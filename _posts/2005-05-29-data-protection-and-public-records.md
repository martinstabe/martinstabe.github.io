The United States may still have a better Freedom of Information regime that most of Europe, but it is lagging behind on its counterpart, data protection for the senstive personal data that frequently lurks in public records. 

The *Washington Post* has an intersesting story about a Virgina woman who is trying to shame public officials into [making it more difficult to obtain sensitive personal data][1], like social security numbers, from American public records.
