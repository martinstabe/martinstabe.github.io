**Harry** at *Harry&rsquo;s Place* has some interesting [observations about the British blogosphere][1]:

> &#8230;in political terms, the interesting thing about the way the British scene has developed is that it has given a space to political views that don&rsquo;t get much representation in the mainstream media. On the left, many of the most popular sites come from the pro-liberation left which has been largely ignored by the liberal media, while on the right it is radical free-market libertarians such as *Samizdata* who get the serious traffic as such views are hard to find in the conservative press.

This gives some nuance to my cruder suggestion [earlier][2] that the British blogosphere is underdeveloped because of the partisan mainstream media in Britain. 

However, it&rsquo;s also important to note that these two minority strands of British politics have something very important in common: They are both hold views that are attractive to American conservatives and can therefore expect a large transatlantic readership via heavyweight blogs.
