I&#8217;m a few days behind on this one, but the conservative blogs have been passing a very worrying piece around, and it&#8217;s worth a mention. In last Friday&#8217;s *Daily Telegraph,*** <a href="http://www.stephenpollard.net/" target="_top">Stephen Pollard</a>,** a senior fellow at the **<a href="http://www.centrefortheneweurope.org/" target="_top">Centre for the New Europe</a> **wrote a <a href="http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/07/do0701.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/07/i opinion.html" target="_top">lot of stuff</a>, but I&#8217;m interested in only one paragraph:  


> Well-connected advisers tell me that if, as now seems likely, the UN refuses to back action against terror, Mr **Bush** will announce a &#8220;temporary&#8221; suspension of America&#8217;s membership, to be accompanied by an offer: if the UN gets its act together and carries out long-overdue reforms, America (and its money) will return. But if there is no reform, the temporary withdrawal  
> will, de facto, become permanent.</p>
I&#8217;ll just let that one sink in. 

This scenario &#8212; thankfully only attributed to unnamed &#8220;well-connected advisors&#8221; &#8212; certainly fits in with the anti-UN agenda that a segment of the American right espouses. Recent talk of the United Nations becoming &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; if it does not endorse U.S. policy also seems to fit this line of thought. This can&#8217;t really be a serious discussion anywhere near Washington. Can it? 

Of course, back in the real world, the UN is doing very important work on preventing catastrophic terrorist attacks. Just yesterday, **Mohamed ElBaradei, **the head of the **International Atomic Energy Agency** (IAEA)&#8212; a UN agency &#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12629-2003Mar11.html" target="_top">called for urgent additional measures</a> to stop terrorists from obtaining a &#8220;dirty bomb.&#8221; ElBaradei said existing controls on radioactive sources, are inadequate, especially in the former Soviet republics. 

Is this work something you want to withdraw funding from? Didn&#8217;t think so.
