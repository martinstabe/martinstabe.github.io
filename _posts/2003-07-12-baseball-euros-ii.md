On day 1 of the baseball Euros yesterday, Great Britain lost to Russia, 4-1. Today they play Italy. Some more European baseball stories: 

  * Former Channel 5 baseball presenter**Josh Chetwynd** has a story about [the Great Britain team][1], of which he is a member, in *The Times*.
  * The *Baltimore Sun* reports on the role of Balitmore Orioles owner **Peter Angelos** in setting up the [Greek national team][2]. The Greek squad, which Great Britain faces on Monday, includes Orioles minor-leaguers **Nick Markakis** and **Chris Lemonis** and former major league catcher **Erik Pappas** and will be managed by Orioles scout **Rob Derksen**, who also headed the Australian national team at the 1996 Atlanta olympics. In a good indicator that bringing in ringers is no longer a sure-fire way to succeed in European baseball, Greece lost their first game, 1-0 to Spain.
  * Germany&#8217;s pre-tournament victory in a friendly against South Africa (and the fact that four members of the local Paderborn Untouchables will be representing Germany) [are mentioned][3] in the *Bielefeld Tagblatt*
  * In the Netherlands themselves, *De Telegraaf* covered the national Honkbal team&#8217;s 7-0 [thrashing of Belgium][4].
