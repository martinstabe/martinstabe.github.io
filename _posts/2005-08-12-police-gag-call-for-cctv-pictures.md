Sky News&rsquo; **Nick Pollard** says the [BBC is mad][1] for continuing to use the CCTV images of the men suspected of attempting to carry out the London bombings [on its web site][2].

Mad? No, just doing the sensible thing. The BBC is defying a police request not to show the pictures, which were [originally issued by the police][3] and are now [available from web sites all over the world][4], because showing them in Britain might compromise the fairness of their trial.

A police request can&rsquo;t result in contempt of court charges, but this could change if the Attorney General or the court issues a gag order, it could happen.

The London bombings have for the past few weeks [demonstrated][5] how the freedom of the UK media is [routinely constrained][6] by Britain&rsquo;s [antiquated contempt of court law][7].
