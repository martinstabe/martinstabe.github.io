After a [strange few hours][1] in the middle of the night, when the German version of Google went offline and the domain Google.de seemed to have changed owners, Google this morning appears to have regained full [ownership of its German domain][2] name.

**12pm: **One German blogger [reports][3] that Google VP Marissa Mayer, speaking at Digital Lifestyle Day in Munich, confirmed the incident but offered no explanation for how it occurred. Apparently the whole thing was sorted out with a nocturnal conference call between Google lawyers and DeNIC.

**1pm:** Google spokesman Stefan Keuchel [tells Bloomberg][4]: “We&#8217;re in the process of finding out who did what exactly &#8230; The Web site hasn&#8217;t been hacked or hijacked.”
