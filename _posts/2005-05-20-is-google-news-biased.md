A new study ([PDF][1]) by **Eric Ulken** of the USC Annenberg School of Communication looks at [political bias in the Google News aggregator][2].

The results?

> &#8230; the findings &#8230; may be of interest given the ongoing debate about the quality of Google News&rsquo;s sources. While my analysis does not indicate an overall conservative or liberal slant, it does confirm Lasica’s suspicion that non-traditional news sources are injecting ideologically biased articles into Google News search results.

> &#8230;almost all of the additional bias in articles returned by Google News searches can be attributed to the site’s use of non-traditional news sources. In other words, if we consider only sources affiliated with old-media companies, the average bias scores for articles on Google News and Yahoo News are virtually identical.

If, like me, you use Google News a lot, you will also be interested in *Private Radio&rsquo;s* study of [Google News&rsquo;s notoriously secret list of news sources][3]. The source list for Google News UK is [here][4].
