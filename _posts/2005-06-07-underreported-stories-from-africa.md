I&rsquo;ve only discovered it now, nearly two months after it was published, but every blogger and journalist ought to read **Koranteng Ofosu-Amaah**&rsquo;s amazing, rambling post about the [underreported stories from Africa][1]. 

Subtitled &ldquo;100 issues that the journalist in me feels the media should investigate&rdquo;, the post nods at loads of interesting stories the author would like to hear more about.

I wasted some time trying to add some value by distilling it into a shorter, bullet-pointed list for the time-constrained, but it just isn&#8217;t possible (or appropriate). [Read it all][1]. If you&#8217;re short on time, scroll down and start reading at the cross-head &ldquo;An African&rsquo;s Perspective&rdquo; That&#8217;s were the rapid-fire list of underreported stories is.
