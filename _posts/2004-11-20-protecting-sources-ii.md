In response to the string of recent court cases in which journalists have been compelled to reveal their sources &mdash; including the [Valerie Plame affair][1] and the [**Jim Taricani** case in Rhode Island][2] &mdash; Senator **Christopher Dodd** yesterday introduced a bill which would create a <a href=""http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article\_display.jsp?vnu\_content_id=1000724169">federal shield law for journalists</a>.

Unsurprisingly, the American media is lining up to support Dodd&rsquo; &ldquo;Free Speech Protection Act of 2004&rdquo;, but Sen. Dodd has already acknowledged that [it will be &ldquo;hard to pass&rdquo;][3].

Thirty-one American states already have shield laws, but all the recent high-profile cases have all been federal cases, and there is no federal law to protect journalists from being forced to testify about their sources.
