A US Army enquiry has concluded that [human error was to blame][1] for [inadvertantly making available redacted sections][2] of the report into the death of Italian agent **Nicola Calipari**.

In response to the goof, *Government Computer News* reports that the Army now has a policy of physically redacting classified sections of documents before scanning them for publication online.
