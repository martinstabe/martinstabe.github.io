Republican Sen. [**John McCain** &ldquo;does not agree&rdquo; the memo][1] showing that** Tony Blair** decided on the Iraq War on July 23, 2002, before the justifications were determined, is wrong.

The document was published by the *Sunday Times* to weeks ago. As CNN says, &ldquo;British officials did not dispute its authenticity.&rdquo;
