*Guardian* editor **Alan Rusbridger** [says][1]:

> Every time you fool yourself that the libel laws are becoming more sensible, reality mugs you. The latest gambit of claimant lawyers is to track down every website and blog in the world which may have mentioned a particular allegation &mdash; and then charge you for the privilege (bargain rates &mdash; no more than &pound;420 to &pound;800 an hour).

> Nice work if you can get it.
