Like <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/06/index.html#001158" target="_top">Tapped</a>, I find the impossibility of getting a decent bagel outside of New York&nbsp;&#8212; indeed, anywhere other than [Ess-a-Bagel][1] on 21st and First &#8212; a pressing quality-of-life issue, and welcome **Mark Kleiman**&#8217;s <a href="http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#200417992" target="_top">groundbreaking analysis</a> of this well-known and distressing phenomenon. 

But if the folks at Tapped think it&#8217;s hard to get an acceptable shmeer in DC, they should try London. As Kleiman suggests, the British supermarkets&#8217; futile efforts to reproduce the bagel are part of the problem, not the solution. And the displaced Noo Yawka in me just can&#8217;t warm to <a href="http://www.eatdrinketc.com/london/source/site_content_item.asp?item_id=788&#038;subchannel_id=57" target="_top">that odd cousin on Brick Lane</a>, the &#8220;beigel&#8221; with salt beef.
