The record $1.2 million fine against the Fox television network for its &ldquo;sexually suggestive&rdquo; programme *Married by America* was brought about by a mere three people who actually composed letters of complaint. The FCC had claimed that it had recieved 159 complaints about the programme. But according to documents disclosed to blogger **Jeff Jarvis**under the Freedom of Information Act, [just three people made these complaints][1].

Jarvis provides some useful advice:

> You, too, can report on government through Freedom of Information Act requests. It is incredibly easy. And it is your right.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> You can go to any government agency and to local government as well and file such requests. You want to know about your mayor&#8217;s expense account? You want to see how other agencies use your tax dollars? File an FOIA request.
> 
> The Freedom of Information Act isn&rsquo;t meant for reporters. It&rsquo;s meant for citizens &#8230; and now citizen journalists. So use it.
