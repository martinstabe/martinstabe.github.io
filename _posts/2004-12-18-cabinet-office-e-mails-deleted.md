*The Times* today reports that the Cabinet Office has ruled that [civil servants must delete e-mails more than three years old][1] , 11 days before the FOIA comes into force.

> Its 2,000 civil servants are being told to print and file e-mails that should be disclosed under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act.
> 
> It will be up to the individual which e-mails are printed, with no monitoring from heads of department. Many officials, who receive about 100 e-mails a day, will have at least 3,000 items in their mailboxes. These include officials in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Strategy Unit, the Delivery Unit, and the offices of **Alan Milburn** and **Sir Andrew Turnbull**, the Cabinet Secretary. 

Hmmm&#8230; what would be easier to access? Printouts or searchable electronic-form e-mails?
