The [franchise for Britain&rsquo;s referendum on the EU constitution][1] is, as expected, based on the franchise for Westminster elections:

> &#8230; a person is entitled to vote in the referendum if, on the day it is held, he is&mdash;
> 
> (a) an individual who would be entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election in a constituency in the United Kingdom;
> 
> (b) a peer who would be entitled to vote as an elector at a local government election in an electoral area in Great Britain or at a local election in an electoral area in Northern Ireland; or
> 
> (c) a Commonwealth citizen who would be entitled to vote in Gibraltar as an elector at a European Parliamentary election.

So, the question of non-British EU citizens has been settled: We don&rsquo;t get a vote &mdash; with one exception. As I pointed out yesterday, subsection (a) does not specificially exclude UK-resident citizens of the Republic of Ireland, who are entitled to vote in Westminster elections. 

I need to do some more checking about what this means, but I do know that the reciprocal agreement between Ireland and the UK &mdash; which is based on the UK&rsquo;s Ireland Act 1949 and the [Ninth Amendment to the Irish consitution][2] &mdash; does not extend to constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland, where Irish-resident UK citizens are excluded, despite being allowed to vote for the *D&aacute;il.*

If Parliament approves the proposed wording, it is therefore conceivable that Irish residents of the UK will find themselves with votes in two countries&rsquo; EU referendums. Does anybody know more?
