**UPDATED**

Apparently [31 per cent of Americans think New Orleans should not be rebuilt][1] after this horrifying disaster ends. 

<s>What a strange question for pollsters to be asking.</s> Apparently, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, **Dennis Hastert**, [expressed doubts about the practicality of rebuilding][2] the city &mdash; [before quickly backtracking][3].

> Sen. **Mary Landrieu** (D-La.) said in a statement, &#8220;While I disagree strongly with Speaker Hastert&rsquo;s comments regarding the city of New Orleans, he raises a debate that we can address at some time in the future. Right now, however, we have important work to do&rdquo;

Of course, there won&rsquo;t be any debate at any point in the future. As **Matthew Yglesias** decide [explains][4], the decision about rebuilding is not up to Hastert, Landrieu or American public opinion to decide on this matter. Lots of individuals&rsquo; personal choices about whether or not to return their labour or capital to that part of the world will collectively decide whether New Orleans will be &ldquo;rebuilt&rdquo;.

Yglesias suspects the oil and tourism industries will return, but many young professionals and property-owners will relocate before the waters recede.
