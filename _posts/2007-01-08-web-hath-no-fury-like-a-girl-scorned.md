The woman who was [outed by the ][1]*[Sunday Times][1] *last year as the blogger who wrote the sex blog (and book) “Girl With a One Track Mind”, seems to be [Googlebomb][2]ing her way to revenge.

The blogger, who writes under the pseudonym Abby Lee, began the year by [posted a rather unflattering e-mail][3] that she received from a the *Sunday Times* journalist shortly before being exposed.

Unsurprisingly, [many other bloggers][4] have linked to the post. Guess [what comes up when you Google “Nicholas Hellen”][5] now? Hint: it’s not *Times Online.*

The ability of bloggers’ collective behavior to affect search results is an important example of how they can affect organisations’ — or individual journalists’ — reputation.

The important thing to remember is that works even when it is not a deliberate campaign. Google&#8217;s search algorithm loves blogs, with their many cross-referencing links and category pages crammed with related information.
