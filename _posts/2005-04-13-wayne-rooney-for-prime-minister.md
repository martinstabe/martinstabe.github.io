Need an argument against [lowering the voting age][1]?

Try [this][2]:

According to the Kids General Election survey, 15 percent of 9- to 14-year-olds surveyed by the Cartoon Network think 19-year-old Manchester United and England striker **[Wayne Rooney][3]** is the best man to be Prime Minister. Fictional wizard **Harry Potter** also garnered a greater share of this yoof vote than **Tony Blair**.

But seriously:

> Instead of Iraq, immigration and the economy, youngsters would want a Prime Minister Rooney to address bullying, school dinners and the burning issue of the recent break-up of boy band Busted. 

(Speaking of arbitary age limits, I like the idea of [U.S.  
states lowering the drinking age back to 18][4].)
