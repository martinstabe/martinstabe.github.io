CBS&rsquo;s investigation into the forged exas Air National Guard documents story has been released ([PDF][1]). Producer **Mary Mapes** has been [fired][2] and three others have been asked for the resignation of four others over the Bush Texas Air National memo story.

Mapes is not just some hack: before she became involved in this major journalistic error, she was also a key figure in breaking the most important investigative story of 2004: [Mapes was the producer who first got hold of the Abu Ghraib photographs][3].

The blogosphere would be a very differnet place if the careers of star bloggers were destroyed [every time it is shown that they had failed to take due diligence][4] before rushing to post accusations.
