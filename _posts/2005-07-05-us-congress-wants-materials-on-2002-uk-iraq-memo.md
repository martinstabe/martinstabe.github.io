Fifty-two members of the US House of Representatives have filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Pentagon, State Department, and White House asking, among other things, for documents regarding &ldquo;[the subject matter of the Downing Street Minutes of July 23, 2002][1]&rdquo; regarding a possible invasion of Iraq in 2002.

It&rsquo;s a huge, broad request, for more or less everything to do with Iraq since **George W. Bush** became president, but it should be interesting to see what the Representatives get back. Some of it might also make waves here in the UK.
