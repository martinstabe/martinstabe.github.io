*MyDD* reports on a [Liberal Democrat &ldquo;war chest fundraising dinner&ldquo;][1] &mdash; in Washington DC. **Jerome Armstrong** says he would have attended if he had been in town:

> &#8230; Among what we here in the US call the cultural creatives or the secular warriors (which makes up the new netroots-based backbone of the Democratic Party), it&rsquo;s the transactional practice of politics by Democrats that enabled conservatives, which we revolted against within the Democatic Party. As such, I find myself with the same reaction toward **Tony Blair** that I hold for **Joe Lieberman**, and I tend to believe (as the post Iraq-invasion elections in the UK have borne out) that there are those in the UK who feel the same. Backing the invasion of Iraq was more than just a political issue&mdash; it stems from a worldview.
> 
> I&#8217;m not predicting an electoral shift toward the LD&rsquo;s (the cards are stacked against that sort of thing), but it&#8217;s plain to see that in terms of holding a worldview that believes in things global, inclusive, fair, and yet libertarian in principle, the Liberal Democrats of the UK share our transformational worldview.
> 
> &#8230;So yea, I&#8217;d gladly chip in to send a few dollars to help elect the democratic wing in the UK.
