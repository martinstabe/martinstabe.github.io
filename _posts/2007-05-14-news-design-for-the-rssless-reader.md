*Guardian Unlimited* has in the past week [drawn a teensy bit of criticism][1] from its readers over the redesign its new front page. [Responding to the feedback][2] today, the site&#8217;s editor, Emily Bell, noted a conversation she had with Jeff Jarvis about the allegedly declining importance of a web site&#8217;s front page.

I will probably never spend much time on the *Guardian Unlimited* front page, even though I think it looks great. It&#8217;s true that among the blogging, RSS-reading classes, web site front pages have become largely an irrelevance. But as Bell observes, it was the much larger contingent of more traditional web users who &#8220;threw an invigorating quantity of cyber-tomatoes in my direction last week&#8221;.

But every once in a while it&#8217;s worth stepping back and remembering how small the group of people who use the web in this way really is. Lloyd Shepherd, reflecting on all this, offers [an important illustration][3] of how thinly-distributed the future remains:

> [F]or my 40th birthday, I had around 18 friends for a party. And I can say with some confidence that of these friends &#8211; graduates all, with very white collar jobs and nice middle-class incomes &#8211; of these friends, only one, perhaps two, have a MySpace profile, a blog, an RSS reader. They’ve never heard of last.fm or 37 Signals. Hardly any of them even have a personal email address, but the ones that do have the one that was given to them by their ISP. And when speaking to them I realise that I live in a rather odd world where all these things are very important, but that this world is much smaller than the one where none of them matter at all.
> 
> &#8230; So let’s remember, when we’re designing, we’re not just designing for saddoes like me. And front doors are still, therefore, important.

I&#8217;ll be bearing this in mind, since much of my time this week is also dedicated to fretting over the [imminent relaunch of a web site][4] (including its front door). Tomatoes are likely, there, too.
