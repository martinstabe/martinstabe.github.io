In the *IHT,* there is a story about the [European Commission&rsquo;s efforts to dispell Euromyths][1] in the British tabloids (and elsewhere).

What always surprises me is how little is known about the Commisssion&rsquo;s London Office&rsquo;s routine [efforts to debunk the tabloid tales][2].

In journalism school I&#8217;ve been taught that newspapers gleefully fact-check each other. I see no evidence of this in the case of the Euromyths.

Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start naming and shaming journalists who perpetrate the myths in flagrent disregard of their professional responsibilities.
