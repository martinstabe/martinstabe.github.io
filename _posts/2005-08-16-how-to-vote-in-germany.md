For the first time in my life, I&rsquo;m going to try to navigate the bureaucracy necessary to claim my right as an *Auslandsdeutscher* to vote in the [early German federal election][1] on 18 September.

As a public service to other Germans living in member states of the Council of Europe, I&rsquo;ll explain the process.

You&rsquo;re entitled to vote in the German federal election if you:

  * Are a German citizen as defined by [Article 116 of the German Basic Law,][2]
  * Are at least 18 years of age on 18 September 2005,
  * Have lived in the Federal Republic of Germany for three consecutive months after 23 May 1949, and
  * are not excluded from voting

If you meet these criteria, you need to gather a bunch of information to fill out a rediculously complex form. You will need the following materials, which German officialdom clearly expects you to have lying around in a nice neat spiral binder or something:

  * The postal address of the *Gemeindebeh&ouml;rde* (local authority) that you were last registered with
  * The address and postcode of the most recent place where you were registered as living in Germany.
  * The dates that you were registered and de-registered from these addresses
  * Your passport or *Personalausweis* (National ID card) number alond with the date of issue and the issuing authority

Right. Got all that stuff? Good. Now [download a form from a web site of the *Bundeswahlleiter*][3] (Federal Director of Elections) called, in superb German bureaucratese, *&ldquo;Antrag auf Eintragung in das W&auml;hlerverzeichnis&rdquo;.* ([PDF][4])

Adobe Acrobat will help you fill this out neatly in duplicate. When you&rsquo;re done, print it out, stick a 60 pence stamp on an envelope and send it to the *Wahlamt* of the local council of the last place in Germany where you were a resident. I found mine using Google.

They will enter you onto the electoral register and send you all the materials you need for a postal ballot.

If you don&#8217;t have access to the Internet, you&rsquo;re clearly not reading this, but you can also get a paper copy of the form from your local embassy, such as [this one][5], in London.

But hurry. The deadline is 28 August.

**Update:** [My postal ballot has arrived][6].
