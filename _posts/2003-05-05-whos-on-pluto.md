The Aspin Institute&#8217;s man in Berlin, **Jeffrey Gedmin,** has been annoying me for some time now with his rants about the uppity Germans&#8217; opposition to the Iraq war. Apparently, anyone who does not view the strategic situation on Earth from this man&#8217;s perspecive must barely be in the same star system as he. Gedmin&#8217;s take on Germans&#8217; &#8220;<a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030505-114607-9090r" target="_top">view from Pluto</a>&#8220;:  


> It is easy to get a rise out of people in Germany. Just mention the 45-nation coalition that helped the United States and Britain in Iraq. &#8220;Yes, Micronesia and El Salvador!&#8221; comes the cynical, hooting reply. &#8230; It is a source of great frustration that &#8220;real&#8221; countries joined the coalition &#8212; nations like Japan, Australia, South Korea, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal.</p>
Regardless of whether anyone actually uttered this unattributed hoot, the point of this criticism was &#8212; and remains &#8212; the rediculous pomposity of the Bush adminsitration to claim a vast coalition when only Britain, Australia and Poland (and a couple of token Danish and Dutch officers somewhere far from the front) actually had any troops on the ground in Iraq. Heck, there were actually more German troops in harm&#8217;s way than Spanish: the Bundeswehr&#8217;s ABC-detection and disposal team never left Kuwait. 

I won&#8217;t get into a detailed fisking of the rest. One other thing, though. Why is the wire service **UPI** reprinting opinion pieces from the conservative ***National Review?*** Could it be because the venerable agency is now part of News World Communications, the <a href="http://www.mediachannel.org/originals/upi-moon.shtml" target="_top">media empire</a> of the Unification Church under Rev. **Sun Myung Moon**? Or that its <a href="http://www.upi.com/biography.htm" target="_top">leadership</a> is stacked with conservatives from both sides of the Atlantic? Here are <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~lowrygr/brill.html" target="_top">some more details</a> if you thought this was anything other than a &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; source of information.
