**Suw Charman** has come up with a standard response for every time there&rsquo;s a [silly article about blogging][1] in the papers:

> I could fisk this *Times* piece so easily, but I just can&rsquo;t be bothered. Reading it is like repeated poking myself in the eyes with a sharpened stick. I just want to scream &ldquo;stop thinking &lsquo;broadcast&rsquo;, you morons!&rdquo;, but I know my voice will just get blown away in the wind of rank stupidity and cluelessness.

Repeat and [link for attribution][2] wherever necessary.
