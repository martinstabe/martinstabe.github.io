The [conflagration][1] currently consuming the British political blogsphere:

  1. Reminds me why I don&#8217;t read many political blogs anymore (Ironically, the [two][2] [blogs][3] question are among the exceptions);
  2. Reminds me somehow of that famous dictum that academic feuds are so vicious because the stakes are so low;
  3. Raises some interesting issues about bloggers&#8217; prerogative to moderate comments as they see fit and how many journalists misrepresent the political blogger subculture as representative of all bloggers.

So do pay attention. [Chicken Yoghurt][4] and [Nosemonkey][5] are particularly good. Paul Linford is [keeping score][6].

I&#8217;ll join Paul on the fence: Even though my politics are probably closer to Tim Ireland&#8217;s than Guido&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll be removing neither Guido nor Bloggerheads from my RSS reader. I enjoy them both, and think there&#8217;s space enough in the blogosphere for both of them.

[about this:][7] If you have something valuable to add to to something like this, do so on your own blog.
