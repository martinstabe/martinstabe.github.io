With (most) [European countries increasingly concerned about their airspace being used by CIA flights][1] linked to &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo; operations, newspapers in [Malta][2] and [Cyprus][3] today noted that some of the CIA flights made stopovers in those island nations.

Meanwhile, [Swedish foreign minister **Laila Freivalds** has dismissed the allegation that extraordinary rendition flights landed in Sweden][4]. Interesting &mdash; if only because the whole renditions story owes a lot to the [investigation][5] into a case in that country by television journalist **Fredrik Laurin**, and because the Swedish government is supposed to be running an investigation of the matter.

A plane linked to the renditions programme yesterday [flew from Iceland to the United States via Newfoundland][6] in Canada. The plane, a turboprop with the number N196D landed at Johnston County Airport in Smithfield, North Carolina.
