A few weeks ago, there was a piece in one of the Islington rags about local GPs&rsquo;s surgeries using 0870 telephone number to make a few pennies off their patients.

Since the beginning of this month, the Department of Health has [banned local doctors from doing this][1]. Unfortunatly, many will be [replacing them with 0844 numbers][2] that cost the same as BT&#8217;s standard rate, but are not covered by the inclusive minutes of some phone packages. 

Pricy premium-rate and non-geographical numbers (those beginning with 0844, 0845, 0870 or 0871) are still used by lots of companies, including ones that people in Britain frequently have to call, such as <s>public</s> utilities.

But there&rsquo;s one web site that is attempting to provide a solution. The site, [saynoto0870.com][3], which is developing a database of the geographical equivalents of premium rate numbers.

One suggestion: GPs&rsquo; surgeries are covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps one way of extracting non-premium numbers of these or any other public bodies might just be to ask for them using the FOIA.
