It has been a [long][1], [extremely][2] [exhausting][3] [few][4] [weeks][5] at *Press Gazette.*

The Wednesday press days were bad. After the inevitable scramble to get the last pages to the printer by 5:30, it was never clear whether the celebrations at the Old Bell on Fleet Street would be the team&#8217;s last. Thanks to the job at hand, the mood in the newsroom was dark but never without a complete sense of humour failure: One Wednesday, we took to using a viral e-mail&#8217;s job predictor to [guess our future careers][6].

The Thursdays, coming in to the office and expecting the worst, were worse. After weeks fo staggering on from week to week, Friday&#8217;s news that the magazine would close almost came as a relief to me.

A lot of bloggers and commentators have been [mentioning][7] the slow demise of my (now former) employer, and there will probably be more coverage this week.

Go read all that for now; I&#8217;m not writing a *Press Gazette* postmortem just yet.
