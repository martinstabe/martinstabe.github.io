*The Sunday Times* reports that Downing Street is refusing its Freedom of Information Act [request to publish e-mails from **Baroness Morgan**][1] to **Tony Blair** regarding **Lord Goldsmith**&rsuo;s advice on the war on Iraq.

> Senior government sources suspect that the e-mails contain a summary of the arguments that No 10 was privately making to Goldsmith that, contrary to his original advice, war was justified because **Saddam Hussein** was in breach of United Nations resolutions.
> 
> It has been reported that Morgan and another key Blair ally, **Lord Falconer**, the lord chancellor, held a meeting with Goldsmith on March 13 to discuss his opinion. Goldsmith has rejected the idea that pressure was put on him.

Confused by all those Lords? I sure am. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it&rsuo;s 2am.

The story leaves the best until the last two grafs:

> A senior source at the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which Falconer heads, said colleagues had been been &ldquo;s\***ing&rdquo; themselves that the Morgan e-mails would be released after No 10 went against precedent and released Goldsmith&rsquo;s full legal advice during the election.

The *Sunday Times* is now appealing to the information commissioner. Good for them.
