It&#8217;s been a tough week, and blogging has had to take a back seat. So just some links. 

**Eddie Vedder** continues to rock. Many papers picked up an AP story that pointed out that &#8220;dozens&#8221; of fans &#8212; later clarified as about 75 &#8212; walked out on Pearl Jam&#8217;s first 2003 U.S. concert in Denver, after <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailynews/093/nation/Dozens_walk_out_of_Pearl_Jam_c:.shtml" target="_top">Vedder&#8217;s anti-Bush antics</a> during the transparently political song &#8220;Bu$hleager.&#8221; As several bloggers have noted, if *only* 75 out of the 19,000 people at the show walked out (during the encore), that should be the story! 

I&#8217;m glad to see that **Tapped** also thinks that the <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/04/index.html#000907" target="_top">elite-free military</a> is an important issue, and that **Matthew Yglesias** <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002969.html#002969" target="_top">got a job</a> that I also once aspired to. I can think of nobody more worthy. Will this lead to the *de facto* merger of two of the best liberal blogs?
