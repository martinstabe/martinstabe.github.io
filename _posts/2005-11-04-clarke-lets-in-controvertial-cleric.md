Apparently not all controvertial clerics need to fear Home Secretary **Charles Clarke**. The founder of the Unification Church or &ldquo;Moonies&rdquo;, [**Sun Myung Moon**, will fly to London today][1] after his decade-old exclusion from Britain was lifted.

There is no suggestion whatsoever that Moon will be [declaring himself the Messiah][2] in Portcullis House while in Britain. 

He leaves [those shenanigans][3] for Capitol Hill.
