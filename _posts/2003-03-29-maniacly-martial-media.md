The *Washington Post* explains why the media coverage looks the way it does. It&#8217;s a function of market-driven journalism. The media consultants, including the aptly-named McVay Media, are saying that a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40057-2003Mar27.html" target="_top">pro-war bias is good for business</a>. 

The *New York Times* has the perfect phrase for the difference between **George W. Bush** and **Tony Blair**: &#8220;the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/28/international/worldspecial/28WATC.html" target="_top">fluency gap</a>.&#8221; I give the *Times* a lot of credit from running stories from a different perspective, by translating stories from *Der Spiegel.* Admittedly, they&#8217;re not providing some of the more outspoken coverage from the German newsmagazine, which has dropped all pretense of being anythign other than staunchly anti-war. One recent feature was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/24/international/europe/24SPIEGEL.html" target="_top">an interview</a> with German foreign minister **Joschka Fischer**, which included this exchange about Fischer&#8217;s hopes for a policy of disarming Iraq without recourse to war:  


> **SPIEGEL:** A nice thought, but to get that done one would have had to avoid making loud noises in the [German] election campaign and to have entered into serious conversations with the Americans. 
> 
> **Fischer:** I did that. Ever since September 18th or 19th, 2001, when Deputy Secretary of Defense **Paul Wolfowitz** in Washington roughly outlined for me what he thought the answer to international terrorism had to be. 
> 
> **SPIEGEL:** And? 
> 
> **Fischer:** His view was that the US had to liberate a whole string of countries from their terrorist rulers, if necessary by force. Ultimately a new world order would come out of this &#8211; more democracy, peace, stability, and security for people.</blockquote>
