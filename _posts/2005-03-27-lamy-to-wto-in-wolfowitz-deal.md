Has part of the [global horse-trading][1] over **Paul Wolfowitz**&rsquo;s appointment to the presidency of the World Bank, it seems the EU countries are demanding U.S. backing for the candidacy of former EU trade Commissioner **Pascal Lamy** as the new director-general of the World Trade Organisation. 

From the *[Observer][2]:*

> Europe&rsquo;s leaders are trying to negotiate for a European deputy to Wolfowitz and there are suggestions the Americans have agreed to back Pascal Lamy, the former European Union trade commissioner, as the next director general of the World Trade Organisation in a behind-the-scenes deal.

The WTO post will be [opening up in August][3], when **Supachai Panitchpakdi**&rsquo;s term will expire.

Lamy&rsquo;s competitors are **P&eacute;rez del Castillo** of Uruguay, **Jaya Krishna Cuttaree** of Mauritius and **Luis Felipe de Sexias Corr&ecirc;a** of Brazil.
