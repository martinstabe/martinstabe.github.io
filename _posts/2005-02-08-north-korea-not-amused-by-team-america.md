[According to the CBC][1] (via the Czech newspaper *Lidove Noviny),* the North Korean embassy in Prague wants the film *Team America: World Police* to be banned in the Czech Republic.

**Kim Jong-il** is the main villain in the *Thunderbirds-*style film by **Trey Parker** and **Matt Stone**, the creators of *South Park.*

The North Korean dictator is a film buff believed to own a collection of around 20,000 videos. According to Wikipedia at least, Parker and Stone have [sent him a gift reel][2] of *Team America.*
