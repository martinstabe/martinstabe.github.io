The *Independent* <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/leading\_articles/story.jsp?story=390144" target=\_top">leader today</a> is excellent. But would somebody please discuss teenagers&#8217; political activism without invoking **Nirvana** in the headline? *Nevermind,* the album that included &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&#8221; was released in 1991. The oldest current secondary school students were six or seven at the time. Can&#8217;t anyone think of any pop culture references more meaningful to the people they&#8217;re talking about? 

**Update:** The *Guardian* mentions the preponderance of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,920898,00.html" target="_top">very young protestors</a> in the recent anti-war demonstrations.
