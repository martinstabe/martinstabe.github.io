Download a [London tube map for your iPod][1] while you still can. 

The New York and San Francisco transit authorities have slapped a [cease-and-desist letter][2] on *iPodSubwayMaps.com,* [citing breach of copyright][3].

It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if London Underground does something similar. [Government copyright issues are much less liberal in Britain][4] than they are in the United States, and wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Transport for London will want to remind the site of the recently-introduced [Re-Use of Public Sector Information Regulations][5].
