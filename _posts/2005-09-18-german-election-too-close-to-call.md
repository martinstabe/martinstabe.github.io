Ooooh. This is getting interesting. 

Following earlier BBC reports of the likely result being a [hung parliament with a CDU plurality][1], *Der Spiegel* now has [exit polls showing <s>a slim SPD lead</s> <s>the major parties dead even</s>][2]. By the time you read this, wharever I last typed will be out of date, because polls are vacillating between which of the two main parties they are projecting to has the most seats in the new *Bundestag.*

[Both party leaders are claiming victory][3] and therefore the right to make the first attempt to form a coalition government.

A [by-election in one Dresden constituency][4], which will be held in two weeks&rsquo; time, may be deciding. The candidate for the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party in that constituency had died during the campaign.

If the *Bundestag* fails to elect a government after three tries, the President can appoint a minority government. For the time being, though, coalition speculation is the main topic of discussion.

Speaking on a television debate Schr&ouml;der told Merkel [he would not form a Grand Coalition][5] led by her. The Liberals are also ruling out joining the red-green government to form a &ldquo;traffic-light coalition&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll see how long those commitments last as the horse-trading that will occur this week.

Both major parties are rejecting a deal with the new Left Party. Of course, they, together with the free-market Liberal FDP, have been the major benefitiaries of the major parties&rsquo; losses compared with the 2002 result. 

Still, the Left Party is now in the position to save the current Government by joining it to form a red-red-green coalition. That outcome is likely to be politically untenable for Schroeder, though, becuase it means letting ex-Communists and rebels from his own party&rsquo;s left wing into government. 

*Der Spiegel* has published a screen-grab mocking the BBC for misinterpreting the results earlier today when a clearer picture was already available in the German media. The best English-language source for news on this is probably the Deutsche Welle English service, which has a streaming broadcast ([RealAudio][6]). *Der Spiegel* provides the [inevitable red-and-blue map][7] of consituency (direct mandate) results. 

The CDU appears to have held [my constituency][8] in North-Rhine Westphalia.
