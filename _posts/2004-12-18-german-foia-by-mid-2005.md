The British Freedom of Information Act was passed in 2000 after nearly three decades of advocacy for it. It comes into force on New Year&rquo;s Day.

The German Parliament is now debating a German equivalent, and the newsmagazine *Der Spiegel* is [reporting][1] that the snappyly-titled *Informationsfreiheitsgesetz* may be law by mid-2005.

But *Die Welt* is [less optimistic][2], noting that the bill in its present form &ldquo;barely has a chance&rdquo; because only the SPD and Green partiamentary groups are supporting the bill, whereas the Government is siding with the CDU and FDP opposition in objecting to it.
