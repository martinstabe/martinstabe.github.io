During his visit to Brussels, President **George W. Bush** will be meeting the heads of only two of the three European Union institutions. 

Bush will meet **Jean-Claude Juncker**, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, whose country currently holds the presidency of the Council of Ministers; he will meet Commission President **Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso**; but he will not be meeting **Josep Borell**, the president of the European Parliament.

According to the *Financial Times,* Borell, a Spanish Socialist MEP who has been a vocal critic of Bush, wrote to Juncker [trying to &ldquo;gatecrash&rdquo;][1] the event &mdash; to no avail.
