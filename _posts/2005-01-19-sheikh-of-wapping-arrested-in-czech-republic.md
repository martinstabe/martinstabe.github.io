Czech media are reporting that the *News of the World&rsquo;s* famous investigations editor, the &ldquo;fake sheikh&rdquo; **Mahmood Mazher**, was arrested last year in the Czech Republic. [According to][1] *The Daily Czech:*

> Czech police together with the help of the Czech Intelligence Agency have detained a British journalist who was charged with &ldquo;instigating a crime&rdquo; in June 2004. **Mahmood Mazher** of *News Of The World* wanted to find out how lame the Czech authorities are when it comes to fight against organized crime.
> 
> The reporter was meeting people who make and sell fake documents, including passports and university diplomas. &#8230; When he was caught at the airport, the journalist also had a fake diploma from medical school.

Mazher is best known for disguising himself as an Arab sheikh to entrap various celebrities, notably **Sophie Rhys-Jones**, Countess of Wessex, whose PR firm was [abusing its royal connections][2]. 

Mazher was crowned reporter of the Year in 1999, but has often been criticised for [his more dubious &ldquo;investigations&rdquo;][3], which have involved instigating crimes which might not otherwise have happened, such as the alleged attempted kidnapping of **Victoria Beckham**.
