As *The Guardian* noted last week, the syndicated political cartoon *Doonesbury* is [causing certain American newspaper editors a lot of trouble][1] of late. [Atrios commenters][2] around the United States reported the following editorial decisions about Sunday&#8217;s *Doonesbury* Memorial Day strip [listing all the American dead in Iraq][3]: 

  * *Omaha World Herald* did not print this strip.
  * The *Houston Chronicle* didn&#8217;t run last weeks strip. This week, they cut the first two panels, then reduced the size to where it was barely noticible.
  * The *Dallas Morning News* did not run the strip, because it (paraphrasing) &#8220;partially duplicated an article&#8221; that they ran in the opinion section. The article only listed Dallas/Fort Worth area deaths.
  * Don&#8217;t know about Minn. paper, but the *Arizona Revolting* (I mean *Republic)* used an alternative strip.
  * the notorious, once-named *Arizona Republican* (sic) printed Doonesbury in yesterday&#8217;s comics. 
  * *Minneapolis StarTribune* didn&#8217;t print this strip on sunday.

*Editor & Publisher* [also covered][4] the latest *Doonesbury* spat, and the *Baltimore Sun* has [a feature][5] about the strip&#8217;s influence.
