**Myron Ebell**, the director of the Global Warming for the ([ExxonMobil-funded][1]) Competitive Enterprise Institute, gave an interview to the BBC&rsquo;s flagship *Today* programme on Thursday ([RealAudio][2] at 3:49), in which he questioned the credibility of non-American scientists and accused European environmental policy-makers of having an ulterior agenda against American business. The interview provoked [listener outgage][3] and a motion censuring him in the House of Commons ([RealAudio][4]).

In the interview, Ebell said there were &ldquo;people who know nothing about climate science like **Sir David King**, your Chief Scientific Advisor, who are alarmist and continually promote this just rediculous claim, but Sir David has no expertise in climate science.&rdquo;

Ebell also suggested that climate change denial is more widespread in the United States than elseqhere because &ldquo;we still have independent scientists in this country&ldquo; whereas &ldquo;virtually all scientific funding in Europe and Japan and Australia is directly from government.&rdquo;

But Ebell&rsquo;s most brazen suggestion that the EU had dubious motivations for its environmental policies:

> In the European Union&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy &mdash; it&rsquo;s right out in the open. **Margot Wallstrom**, the EU Commissioner for the Evironment, outgoing, said at one point and was quoted in I belive one of the London papers, that this is much more of a scientific issue or an environmental issue. This was about levelling the global playing field for business. And that&#8217;s because European businesses are not competitive in most areas with American businesses, and by putting a governor on our energy use the EU actually hopes to slow down and hamper American competitiveness. &#8230; I think that is pretty obviously and explicitly the programme of the EU Commission.&rdquo;

The quote in question probably comes from Wallstrom&rsquo;s reactions to President **George W. Bush**&rsquo;s renuciation of the Kyoto protocol. Here&rsquo;s what the *Independent* reported on 30 March 2001:

> Margot Wallstrom, the European Commissioner for the Environment, said Washington had to be made aware that &ldquo;this is not &#8230; some kind of marginal environmental issue that can be ignored or played down; it is to do with international relations, trade and economics.&rdquo;
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> As Ms Wallstrom said yesterday, the US position goes to the heart of the principle of nations trading freely on a level playing field. The Commissioner argued: &ldquo;Why should we put European business and European companies under such pressure and let American companies off the hook? Why should they play by other rules than European companies.&rdquo;

In other words, Wallstrom wasn&rsquo;t suggesting that Kyoto Protocols could be used to bolster uncompetitive European businesses. Quite the opposite, in fact: she was concerned that Amreican withdrawal from the treaty would distort transatlantic competition in American companies&rsquo favour.
