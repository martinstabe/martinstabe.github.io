The *Today* programme this morning featured a package about &ldquo;citizen journalism&rdquo; ([RealAudio][1]).

**[Ian Hargreaves][2]** of Cardiff University is a fan, saying that journalism has been over-professionalised.

**Neil McIntosh** of the *Guardian* web site, who is [less of a fan][3], said shouldn&rsquo;t expect &ldquo;citizen journalism&rdquo; should be expected to solve all the problems of professional journalism.

Worth a listen.
