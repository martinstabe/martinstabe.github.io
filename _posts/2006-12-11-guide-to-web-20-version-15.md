Thanks to Paul Bradshaw for [articulating][1] the snarky first reaction that I also had to Ifra’s [guide to Web 2.0 for newspapers publishers.][2]

Given the subject matter, there certainly is just a slight bit of irony in producing an online version of a magazine that painstakingly recreates the visual experience and linear structure of the print product.

I would link to some choice excerpts from the guide, but I can&#8217;t because it&#8217;s one huge Flash document that allows neither deep linking nor cutting-and-pasting. Not very 2.0, that.

Never mind — Ifra&#8217;s [*Newspaper Techniques*][3] special is still worth reading, er, cover to cover. (And there are some hyperlinks, so it&#8217;s not completely linear).

**Meanwhile:** Tim O&#8217;Reilly is attempting to develop [a compact definition for Web 2.0][4], the term he is credited with coining.
