The *Guardian* today had a <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/interviews/story/0,11660,949698,00.html" target="_top">profile</a> of New Labour&#8217;s rising star, the 37-year-old schools minister, **David Miliband**. The story observes that  


> Miliband is a bit of preacher, as one might expect from the son of a famous Marxist thinker.</p>
I just love the juicy irony that the son of **Ralph Miliband**, who is best known as the leading proponant of the &#8220;instrumentalist&#8221; school of Marxist state theory (which focuses the relationship between the state&#8217;s bureaucratic elite and the capitalist class) is now <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,815389,00.html" target="_top">being described</a> as the &#8220;next prime minister but one&#8221;:  


> His late father would be proud of that success &#8211; and perhaps a little bemused by it. Ralph Miliband was one of the foremost Marxist theorists of the twentieth century. The joke among today&#8217;s left-wingers goes like this: Ralph Miliband argued that the Labour Party would never do anything for the working class; his son is going to prove it.</p>
Heh.
