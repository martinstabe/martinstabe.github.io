After the Institute for Fiscal Studies released [figures on changing levels of income][1] in Britian, it was predictable that different newspapers would [manipulate the figures][2] to present them in a way that suits their political line.

In short, the data shows an &ldquo;average&rdquo; 0.2 per cent drop in household incomes between 2002/3 and 2003/4. This interpretation suits right-leaning newspapers. But, as any foo&rsquo; (who has taken freshman-stats-for-trees) know, taking the mean skews the data because it is disproportionatly affected by changes in income among high earners. Using the median or splitting the data into income quintile classes provides a much more interesting picture. **Jim** of *Our Word is Our Weapon* provides an [elementary statistics primer][3] explaining all this and showing the real story with his trademark charts. He also provides an [income distribution chart][4] showing the difference between mean, median, and mode. (Want to know where you belong on this graph? [Go here][5].)

It really is a good example of how journalists can lie (or at least demonstrate incompetence) with statistics. *British Spin* goes so far as to [charge][6] that *Evening Standard&rsquo;s* Finance Editor **Anthony Hilton**, &ldquo;either cannot read a press release or is terminally dishonest&rdquo; after he wrote that the IFS data show that &ldquo;most people&rdquo; are worse off.
