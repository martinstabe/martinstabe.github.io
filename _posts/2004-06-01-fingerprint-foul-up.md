But&#8230; but&#8230; but&#8230; Biometrics are magical and infallible! Nope. The *New York Times* has the story about the traumatic results for an innocent man when his [fingerprints were mixed up][1] with those of a petty criminal. I can&#8217;t wait when we&#8217;re all on a national biometric database, because then these things will never, never happen again. Or maybe the more likely outcome is that they will become more common by several orders of magnitude.
