The *Wall Street Journal* recently ran a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB105569204828218700,00.html" target="_top">story on journalistic conventions</a>, which quoted UC San Diego professor **Michael Schudson**, a leading sociologist of journalism. The story centred on one **Greg Packer**, a highway-maintenance worker from Huntington, Long Island, who is always available for a vox pop soundbite. Interestingly, by leading with a personal anecdote to illustrate a more general point, the *WSJ* provided an excellent illustration of another stylistic convention of the journalistic genre.
