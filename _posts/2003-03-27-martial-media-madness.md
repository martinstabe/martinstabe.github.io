From the *Guardian* Media section: 

  * New York correspondent **Gary Younge** on <a href="" target="_top">wartime McCarthyism</a> in America
  * A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,922345,00.html" target="_top">guide to the warblogs</a> and a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/subsection/0,12809,884056,00.html" target="_top">guide to anti-war web sites</a>
  * The <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,922184,00.html" target="_top">awkward squad</a> liven things up in Qatar
  * Al-Jazeera is at the centre of <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,922932,00.html" target="_top">a new controversy</a> about what it airs, and wins an <a href="" target="_top">anti-censorship award</a>.

From the *New York Times:* 

  * Journalists from some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/international/worldspecial/27MTV.html" target="_top">surprising media outlets</a>, including *Rolling Stone,* *People* magazine and MTV, are among the embeeded hacks in Iraq. &#8220;It is a recognition that not everyone gets their news from *The Washington Post* and *The Wall Street Journal,&#8221;* **Bryan G. Whitman,** deputy assistant secretary for media operations for the Pentagon, told the *Times*. The article also quotes *Rolling Stone* editor **Jann Wenner,** who said &#8220;I know that this is part of a big propaganda machine and they recognize our demographics.&#8221;

From the *Washington Post* 

  * Media columnist **Howard Kurtz,** true to form, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34033-2003Mar26.html" target="_top">criticises the BBC</a> for &#8212; get this &#8212; being objective. The column reads like Kurtz&#8217; Roladex is the culled from the News Corp payroll: he unleashes veteran Beeb-bashers **Andrew Sullivan** and **William Rees-Mogg** to spout their usual refrains. Yawn.

From the blogs:

  * **iWire** on the <a href="http://www.theisociety.net/archives/000523.html#000523" target="_top"><b>Jo Moore</b> quality</a> of much of the war news.
  * Two more blogs have been blogrolled: <a href="http://www.cursor.org/" target="_top">Cursor.org</a> and <a href="" target="_top">The Memory Hole</a>.
  * The <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org" target="_top">Iraq Body Count</a> web site is seeking to ensure that the unpleasant truths about warfare are not forgotten.

Another good general source lately has been The <a href="http://www.poynter.org/" target="_top">Poyner Institute</a> 

**Update:** Some people are suggesting that Iraq Body Count may be a [coalition propaganda excercise][1]. No evidence for this yet, but a pinch of salt may be advisable.
