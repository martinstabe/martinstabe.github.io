A 38-year-old U.S. Marine, Sgt. **Gus Covarrubias**, is <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/editorandpublisher/headlines/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1878760" traget="_top">under investigation</a> by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service after he told his hometown newspaper, the *Las Vega Review-Journal,* that he had <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Apr-25-Fri-2003/news/21188509.html" target="_top">executed a prisoner</a> in Iraq.

> &#8220;I went behind him and shot him in the back of the head,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Twice.&#8221; 
> 
> Then, he said, he found the man&#8217;s partner outside trying to escape. 
> 
> &#8220;I shot him, too.&#8221; 
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;m not vindictive,&#8221; he said.

> [...]

> &#8220;And I might get in trouble for telling you this, but I take it very personally when you do that to my family. The Marines are my family.&#8221; 
> 
> [...]He took stock of the location of the grenade strike and its trajectory, figuring it must have been fired from a nearby house. He sneaked inside. Upstairs, he said, he found the Special Republican Guard member with the grenade launcher next to him. 
> 
> He said he ordered the man to stop, forced him to turn around, and removed his black beret. He shot him twice in the back of the head. 
> 
> He took the man&#8217;s military ID as a souvenir. 
> 
> Outside, the man&#8217;s partner was escaping. Covarrubias said he chased him down and killed him as well. He took the man&#8217;s ID and his AK-47 assault rifle. 
> 
> &#8220;This,&#8221; he said in the interview, holding up the two ID cards, &#8220;is justice.&#8221; </blockquote>

> According to **John Pike**, director of Globalsecurity.org, the inquiry would revolve around the question of whether Covarrubias <a href="" target="_top">killed a prisoner of war</a>:

He was a POW,&#8221; said Pike, one of the nation&#8217;s leading civilian experts on the U.S. military. &#8220;We do not allow our soldiers to execute POWs at their own discretion. And this, as described, looks like the summary execution of a POW.&#8221; 
> > 
> > Pike said if Covarrubias is not cleared of wrongdoing, the killing as he described it could result in a criminal charge of &#8220;failure to accept surrender&#8221; or the more serious charge of murder. 
> > 
> > &#8220;It could be interpreted either way,&#8221; Pike said. &#8220;Normally, when we think about shooting somebody in the back of the head, you think about that as murder. But I think that soldiers who have experienced combat are going to look at it and see it as a failure to accept surrender.&#8221;

> > &#8220;These kinds of incidents are a lot more common than anyone is ever going to let on. But it&#8217;s usually not the sort of thing people talk about,&#8221; Pike said. &#8220;The Iraqis quite possibly did it to us, and I&#8217;m not surprised we did it to them, but it&#8217;s not supposed to happen.&#8221;</blockquote>
