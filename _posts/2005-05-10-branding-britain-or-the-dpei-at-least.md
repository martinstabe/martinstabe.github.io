So the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) has been [reshuffled off this mortal coil][1]. Vast sums will, no doubt, be spent coming up with a clever new logo and branding for the [hideously-renamed][2] [Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry][3] (DPEI).

The fact that British government departments, agencies and assorted public bodies all have seperate logos and brand identities is a bit odd. They are all part of one aparatus, after all. Wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense &mdash, and be substantially cheaper when sudden re-organisations occur &mdash; if all state bodies simply adopted some uniform design that can be easily amended? You know, symbolising joined-up Government and all that?

That&rsquo;s what Canada does under its [Federal Identity Program][4]. [Australia][4] and [Germany][5] have similar approaches to their governement departments&rsquo; &ldquo;corporate design&rdquo;.

Perhaps a brand consultant could be found who would make this suggestion at great expense to the tax payer.
