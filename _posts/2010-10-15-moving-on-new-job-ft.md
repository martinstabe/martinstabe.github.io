It&#8217;s my last day at Emap and [Retail Week][1] today. On Monday, I&#8217;ll be joining the the Financial Times as a producer on [FT.com&#8217;s interactive desk][2]. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to finally <s>practice</s> practise the area of journalism that has most fascinated me in recent years — the visualisation of data and integration of multimedia elements in online journalism. I&#8217;m very excited about it. Expect the focus of this blog to shift a bit towards tags like Flash, HTML5, graphics, visualisation and data.

As excited as I am about that, I&#8217;m going to miss working at Emap. Over the [last two years][3], I&#8217;ve been hugely privileged to work with an amazing team of journalists in the retail group here, and particularly some great digital editors in Andre Rickerby, [Keely Stocker][4] and [Kate Donovan][5].

We [relaunched four websites][6] — Retail Week, [Drapers][7], [Retail Jeweller][8] and [Professional Beauty][9]. We successfully pioneered [implementing Emap&#8217;s much-discussed paywall strategy][10]. We vastly improved what we do in terms of search engine optimisation, email newsletters, and video content. We launched and integrated a [brilliant rich data product][11] and have several others in the works.

There&#8217;s so much left to be done here — I&#8217;m sad to be leaving two very exciting projects in the pipeline. But they will soon be in the very capable hands of [Victoria Thompson][12].
