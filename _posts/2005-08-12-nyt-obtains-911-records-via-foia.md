The *New York Times* will today [obtain more than 12,000 pages of material relating to the response to the 9/11 attacks][1] from the Fire Department of New York, including a written log of radio transmissions made on the day.

The *Times* forced the City of New York to release the material using new York&rsquo;s freedom of information law request in 2002. It is only now being released after a lengthy court battle. In the meantime, some of the material has already been leaked to the *Times.*

Let this be a lesson to British journalists who are already complaining about how much persistence it takes to see results under Britain&squo;s new FOIA laws. The big story may take some time and is no substitute for developing &ldquo;unofficial sources&rdquo;.
