A *Daily Telegraph* investigation today finds that &ldquo;Government agencies are making millions of pounds every year&rdquo; by [using expensive 0870 telephone numbers][1].

Back in April, the Department of Health [banned the practice][2] for GPs&rsquo; surgeries. But many other types of government helplines are clearly still at it. 

[Saynoto0879.com][3], a very useful database of organisations that use expensive non-geographical numbers. Callers to public bodies should probably bookmark that site.
