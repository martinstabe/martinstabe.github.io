In an apparent slip, a CIA official has revealed that [the US intelligence budget is $44 billion][1].

A long-time CIA official, **Mary Margaret Graham** mentioned the number, which the US government has long argued must be kept classified, at an intelligence conference in Texas last week.

According to the *New York Times,*

> The figure itself comes as no great shock; most news reports in the last couple of years have estimated the budget at $40 billion. But the fact that Ms. Graham would say it in public is a surprise, because the government has repeatedly gone to court to keep the current intelligence budget and even past budgets as far back as the 1940&#8242;s from being disclosed.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> **Steven Aftergood**, director of the [Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists][2], expressed amused satisfaction that the budget figure had slipped out.
> 
> &ldquo;It is ironic,&rdquo; Mr. Aftergood said. &ldquo;We sued the C.I.A. four times for this kind of information and lost. You can&rsquo;t get it through legal channels.&rdquo;
> 
> Only for a few past years has the budget been disclosed. After Mr. Aftergood&rsquo;s group first sued for the budget figure under the Freedom of Information Act in 1997, **George J. Tenet**, then the director of central intelligence, decided to make public that year&#8217;s budget, $26.6 billion. The next year Mr. Tenet did the same, revealing that the 1998 fiscal year budget was $26.7 billion.
> 
> But in 1999, Mr. Tenet reversed that policy, and budgets since then have remained classified with the support of the courts. Last year, a federal judge refused to order the C.I.A. to release its budget totals for 1947 to 1970 &mdash; except for the 1963 budget, which Mr. Aftergood showed had already been revealed elsewhere.

Oops.
