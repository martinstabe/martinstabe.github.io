This evening I went to a * Journalism.co.uk* event at Imperial College featuring [Clyde Bentley][1], who founded MyMissourian.com at the University of Missouri, along with *Guardian* blogs editor [Kevin Anderson][2] and [Robin Hamman][3] of the BBC blogs project.

This &#8220;midwestern mafia&#8221;, as Kevin described the American-accented panel, talked about who Robin called &#8220;stuff&#8221; to avoid the dread phrases &#8220;UGC&#8221; and &#8220;citizen journalism&#8221;. And it was great stuff as you would expect from that panel.

Robin explained the [BBC Manchester Blog Project][4], which is encouraging bloggers to use non-BBC platforms like Blogger and Flickr but to use the tag &#8220;bbcmanchesterblog&#8221; to draw alert the BBC to new material. Blogging gives journalists &#8220;contact, context and content&#8221;, he said.

Kevin described the [*Guardian&#8217;s* new Travel site][5] as the first itiration of &#8220;R2&#8243;, the relaunch which will bring interactivity from the margins to the centre of the *Guardian&#8217;s* online operations.

Blogging at 1:45am on a school night is not good, so more details will follow tomorrow.

I&#8217;ve just come home from White City where I was a guest on BBC Five Live&#8217;s *[Pods & Blogs][6]* with Chris Vallance and Rhod Sharp. If you&#8217;re still up at the unsocial hour of 2am, you can listen to me provide several shameless plugs for this blog. ([listen online][7])
