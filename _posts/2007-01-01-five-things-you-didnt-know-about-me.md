I watched with trepidation as [the &#8220;five things&#8221; meme][1] wound its way closer and closer towards me — It was really only a matter of time. And of course while I was away for the holidays, both [Bryan Murley][2] and [Graham Holliday][3] tagged me.

So here, belatedly and with apologies, are the Five Things You Didn&#8217;t Know About Me. The first one might interest Bryan:

  1. Before I was a journalist, I was a sociology student interested in the processes of journalism and news production. My undergraduate honours thesis was a newsroom ethnography of an American college newspaper — [*The Daily Northwestern*][4]. My &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; in Evanston was carried out during the 1999-2000 academic year, but I made almost no mention of the paper&#8217;s web site, so I suspect it&#8217;s a [fairly dated piece of work already][5].
  2. I became interested in journalism on 20 November 1988, when my parents took me, aged nine, to an exhibition about newspapers at the [Staten Island Children&#8217;s Museum][6]. I know the date with such freakish precision because the following day&#8217;s date appears on the fanzine-style &#8220;newspaper&#8221; I cranked out on my father&#8217;s old typewriter that evening.
  3. I have won three national championships in baseball since 1998. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not saying very much because they were all with the [Brighton Buccaneers][7], who play here in Britain, where baseball is a pretty eccentric sporting pursuit.
  4. My thumbs are double jointed. Paul [Davidson recently described][8] people with this talent thus: &#8220;[T]hey can &#8230; flick their thumbs out of whack in a weird dance-like rhythm that is both intriguing and nauseating all at once.&#8221;
  5. Like many people, I think [Brussels sprouts][9] are the vilest vegetable; just thinking about them invokes my gag reflex. Luckily the seasonal high-risk period for accidentally encountering the hideous mini-cabbages is now drawing to a close.

There. So now who shall I burden with this task? The major disadvantage of waiting ten days to respond to being tagged by a meme is that just about every blogger I read has already played. A quick search of my RSS shows that much of my regular reading list has already succumbed. [Amanda Congdon][10], [Jeff Jarvis][11], [Howard Owens][12], [Mindy McAdams][13], [Andy Dickinson][14], [Peter Krasilovsky][15], [Matt Waite][16], [Danny Sullivan][17], [Ryan Sholin][18], [Lucas Grindley][19], [Ethan Zuckerman][20], [Euan Semple][21], [Tim O&#8217;Reilly][22], [Anthony Mayfield][23], [Rebecca MacKinnon][24], [K. Paul Mallash][25], [Danny Sanchez][26] have all told us their five things already. Will Sullivan set the bar pretty high with a great [two][27]-[part][28] response, and Susan Mernitt has a nice [roundup][29] of her favourite responses.

Lots of others on my usual reading list have already been tagged but haven&#8217;t responded yet. However, it seems [Adrian][30], [Neil][31] and [Linda][32] have escaped unscathed — so I&#8217;m tagging them. And perhaps I can move this out of the incestuous circle of meeja-bloggers by also tagging two of the UK political bloggers you should really be reading, [Clive][33] and [Tim][34].
