Former New York City Mayor **Rudolph Giuliani** is &ldquo;[too busy][1]&rdquo; to run for governor of New York or to challenge **Hillary Clinton**&rsquo;s New York Senate seat in 2006.

To find out what&rsquo;s keeping him so busy, and why he&rsquo;s unlikely to be running for President in 2008, we turn to the *New York Observer&rsquo;s* front-page story, &ldquo;[Really Rich Rudy][2]&rdquo;:

> &#8230; on Feb. 9 in Columbia, S.C. Mr. Giuliani had initially been booked by the South Carolina Hospital Association through the Washington Speakers Bureau to speak for his usual $100,000 fee. But then a massive tsunami devastated South Asia and &ldquo;we just didn&rsquo;t feel that a big old party was the right thing,&ldquo; said **Patti Smoake**, the hospital association&rsquo;s spokeswoman.
> 
> Instead, the South Carolinians held a fund-raiser called &ldquo;From South Carolina to South Asia.&rdquo;
> 
> Mr. Giuliani agreed to speak at the new event. He even wrote a $20,000 check to the Red Cross, the event&rsquo;s beneficiary, according to figures cited by a South Carolina hospital official and obtained by The Observer. He batted away the inevitable political speculation that accompanied his visit to the crucial Republican primary state, telling a local reporter he was visiting &ldquo;because I enjoy coming to South Carolina and because this is a worthy cause.&rdquo;
> 
> Mr. Giuliani didn&rsquo;t mention it at the time, but he also walked away from the tsunami benefit with $80,000 at a time when celebrities from **Bill Clinton** and the first **President Bush** to **George Clooney** were donating time to the relief effort. There was nothing illegal, or even particularly unusual, about his taking a fee from a charity event. But taking the money was not the move of a man whose political future depends on the good will of the voters of South Carolina, the decisive state in the 2000 Republican primary widely viewed as the immovable object between a socially liberal Republican like Mr. Giuliani and the nomination.

> 
> Mr. Giuliani&rsquo;s spokeswoman, **Sunny Mindel**, told The Observer that the former Mayor gave generously to tsunami relief after the wave hit in December, and confirmed that he&rsquo;d given money again in South Carolina, though she wouldn&rsquo;t discuss the amount. Mr. Hess said Mr. Giuliani&rsquo;s contribution was twice what the Hospital Association had suggested.

Now, let&rsquo;s see&#8230; Twice $20,000 is&#8230;

What a nice guy. (Via *[Gadflyer][3])*
