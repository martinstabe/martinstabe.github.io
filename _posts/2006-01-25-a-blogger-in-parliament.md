In a transport debate yesterday, Liberal Democrat MP **Sandra Gidley** [read her blog into *Hansard*][1]:

> One of the most peculiar barriers to rail transport is the ability to find a car parking space at many local stations. An e-mail that I received from one of my constituents stated:
> 
> *&ldquo;I know you have experienced the same problems which we (from villages) all face over parking at stations in our area.&rdquo;*
> 
> He knows that, because I have a blog. At one stage, I went on about the problem at great length &mdash; probably at far greater length than was healthy.

This is certainly a promising sign that blogging is a useful tool for people to interact with their elected representatives. But unhealthy blogging? [Judge for yourself][2].
