Two higher education stories on the BBC web site this morning. According Higher Education Statistics Agency, there was a [8.6 percent increase in first-year students][1] over last year.

But the Higher Education Funding Council for England said there was severe inequality in where all those freshers come from. According to their chief executive, &ldquo;more people went to university between 1994 and 2000, but the [percentage of poorer students had &lsquo;hardly changed at all&rsquo;][2].&rdquo;

Oh, and the *Economist* says it&rsquo;s the [foreign students who are paying][3] for all this.
