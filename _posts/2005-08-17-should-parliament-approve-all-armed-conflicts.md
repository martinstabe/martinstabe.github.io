With the [Lords looking at the war-making powers of the prime minister][1] under the Royal Perogative, a similar issue is arising in the commons.

A private member&rsquo;s bill sponsored by **Clare Short** would require Parliamentary approval for all deployments of British armed forces in armed conflict. The House of Commons library has published a research paper for the bill ([PDF][2]).

The Armed Forces (Parliamentary Approval for Participation in Armed Conflict) Bill will have its second reading on 21 October.
