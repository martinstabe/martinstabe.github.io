Lest you get the idea that the &#8220;freedom fries&#8221; hot air blows exclusively east across the Atlantic, here are some people who are currently making the European anti-war movement look bad. First, <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp?pad=190,205,&#038;item_id=30269" target="_top">some dumb news</a> from my native city:  


> WIESBADEN &#8211; Germans should purge English words from their vocabulary in protest against the United States and Britain for the war in Iraq, a top linguist urged Monday. 
> 
> In place of English words, people should use French words in a show of solidarity with France, which along with Germany has opposed the war, said **Armin Burkhardt**, chairman of the Wiesbaden-based working group &#8220;<a href="http://www.sprache-in-der-politik.de" target="_top">Language in Politics</a>&#8220;.

Yeah, professor, that&#8217;s really going impress the neo-conservatives in Washington and stop the war. 

But at least he&#8217;s not as silly as Dr. **Eberhard Hoffmann**, a German dermatologist who [forbids entry to his practice][1] to Americans, Britons, and everyone who supports the war. Bizzarely, he has a very clear understanding of the injustice he is perpetrating:  


> &#8220;We always hear about the collective guilt of Germans, and by the same token I am not prepared to treat Americans, Britons or their sympathisers.&#8221;</p>
He should be struck off for this flagrant breach of medical ethics. 

**Update**: Thanks to reader **G.A.** for the excellent multilingual copy-editing service.
