Writing in the *Western Mail,* **Lowri Turner** [outs herself as a fool][1]:

> &#8230; I don&#8217;t think gay men make good party leaders or Prime Ministers. This has nothing to do with what they do in bed but everything to do with their lives in general.
> 
> Before I am accused of prejudice, I should say that not only are some of my best friends gay, but probably most of them are. I work in the media, for goodness sake. It is precisely because I know such a lot of gay men that I can say that I don&#8217;t think many of them are capable of representing the interests of the vast majority of people.
> 
> Their lifestyles are too divorced from the norm. They are not better or worse, but they are different.
> 
> Gay men face challenges of their own, but they do not face those associated with having children which is the way most of us live. I have gay friends whose biggest headache is whether to have a black sofa or a cream one. If they have a child it is a dog.

Er&#8230; leaving aside the [obvious emperical deficiencies of some of her factual claims][2], that logic disqualifies childless heterosexuals for public office, too. Perhaps nobody should run the country because everyone has a few unique problems determined by their job, age, class, religion or sexual orientation that makes their lifestyles &ldquo;too divorced from the norm&rdquo;. 

For example, how do public school educated barristers relate to &ldquo;the interests of the vast majority of people&rdquo;?

**Update:** See also the [response][3] from Welsh Assembly member **Peter Black**: &ldquo;According to Lowri Turner, the only person who should be PM is a white middle class man or women with 2.4 kids and a mortgage.&rdquo;
