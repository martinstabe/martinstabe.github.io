That blasted BBC firewall. 

I&#8217;ve been getting an interesting referrals from what looks like one of the internal BBC blogs, but of course I can&#8217;t go see what they&#8217;re saying about me.

Can anyone tell me a bit more about *[New Media Express][1]?* Sounds interesting. Who are the guilty parties?
