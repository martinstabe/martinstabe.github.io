With all the attention on North Korea, perhaps Eurocentric blogs like this one should be keeping a closer eye on the increasing &#8220;bilateral estrangement&#8221; between China and Japan.

The tensions are palpable at the elite level, such as the recent [tensions over the Senkaku Islands][1] near Taiwan. A lot of this has to do with access to [potential oil reserves in the area][2].

But they are even more serious at the cultural level. [Football matches between the two countries][3] are not a pretty sight, and there are suggestions that &ldquo;[anti-Japanese nationalist sentiment][4] is now being exploited to boost the Communist leadership&#8217;s waning ideological authority&rdquo;.

Much of the Chinese anger geared towards Japan relates to the sense that Japan has not adequatly atoned for its crimes during the Second World War. A major sticking point is Japanese Prime Minister **Junichiro Koizumi**&rsquo;s [visits to the Yasakuni Shrine][5] in Tokyo, where Japanese war dead, including a number considered war criminals, are buried.

The Japanese are concerned about the Chinese military and arms sales to it by Israel and the European Union. And according to **Simon Tisdall** in the *Guardian,* [Russia is siding with Japan][4] because it shares this concern.
