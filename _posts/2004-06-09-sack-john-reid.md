Tony Blair has hinted that his government may allow local councils to [ban smoking in enclosed public places][1]. This is good news.

But Blair&#8217;s usual ally (and my least-favourite British politician), John Reid, has once again [said something incredibly stupid][2]. This man, mind you, is the friggin&#8217; *health secretary:*  


> Mr Reid said that the middle classes were obsessed with giving instruction to people from lower socio-economic backgrounds and that smoking was not one of the worst problems facing poorer people.</p> 
> 
> &#8220;I just do not think the worst problem on our sink estates by any means is smoking, but it is an obsession of the learned middle class,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What enjoyment does a 21-year-old single mother of three living in a council sink estate get? The only enjoyment sometimes they have is to have a cigarette.&#8221; 

Read makes two valid points. There really is a diffence between policies that &#8220;empower&#8221; citizens and top-down proscriptions of individual choice in the name of individuals&#8217; own interests. And of course smoking is not being the biggest problem on Britain&#8217;s sink estates. Too bad both these true statements are spurious. They are just populist straw men that misrepresent the actual debate. Those anti-smoking campainers are not especially interested in smoking in sink estates: Their most powerful argument is that smoking should be banned in workplaces like bars and restaurants, where poorly-paid staff have no choice but to inhale second-hand smoke. There&#8217;s nothing &#8220;nanny state&#8221; about this: It&#8217;s a pretty standard liberal argument about reducing the harm to captive bystanders caused by individuals&#8217; action in public. Assuming the smoker is an adult, the harm they do to themselves is really only a secondary concern. Funny that a *Labour* Party minister doesn&#8217;t think about it that way; [the unions representing those workers do][3].

If Reid wants to make this a class issue, he should stop patronising working class single mothers and read this paragraph in the *Guardian* report of his comments:  


> According to Ash, men in socio-economic groups AB are twice as likely to reach the age of 70 as those in groups DE, with smoking being the biggest contributing factor. Women in social class 5 are almost twice as likely to die from lung cancer as women from social class 1.</p>
