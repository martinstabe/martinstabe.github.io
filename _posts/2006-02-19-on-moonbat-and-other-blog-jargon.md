Columnist and language maven **William Safire** has a fun piece on [blog jargon][1] in the *New York Times Magazine.* 

Apparently those rascally bloggers have pinched some of journalism&rsquo;s jargon:

> Some of our special vocabulary is being stolen from us by the denizens of the world of Web logs. *Above the fold* &mdash; the top half of a standard-size newspaper page, where the major stories begin &mdash; now, in &ldquo;blargon,&rdquo; is what we see on a blog&rsquo;s screen before we begin to scroll down. The *jump* &mdash; the continuation of an article on an inside page &mdash; is now a place to which the blog&rsquo;s readership is referred inside the Web site. A *sidebar* &mdash; which we fondly remember as a boxed, related article alongside the main newspaper article &mdash; is, to a blogger, a column down one side of the screen displaying advertisements, archived links or a list of other blogs called a blogroll. Even the reporter&rsquo;s *byline,* that coveted assertion of journalistic authorship, has been snatched by the writers derogated as &ldquo;guys in pajamas&rsquo; and changed to *bye-line,* an adios or similar farewell at the end of the blogger&rsquo;s politely expressed opinion or angry screed. (The prevailing put-down of right-wing bloggers is *wingnuts;* this has recently been countered by the vilification of left-wing partisans who use the Web as *moonbats,* the origin of which I currently seek.)

My recollection (and, apparently, the recieved wisdom) is that &ldquo;moonbat&rdquo; was orignially a reference to British environmentalist and lefty journalist **George Monbiot**. 

That&rsquo;s certainly what appears in [Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry for &ldquo;moonbat&rdquo;][2], which also credits British libertarian blogger **Perry de Havilland** of *[Samizdata][3]* with having coined the term. 

But we all know about Wikipedia&rsquo;s [much-vaunted accuracy][4]. On his own blog&rsquo;s glossary, de Havilland claims credit for the term but [denies the Monbiot connection][5].
