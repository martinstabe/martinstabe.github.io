Ben McConville in the *Scotland on Sunday* newspaper speculates &#8212; apparently baselessly &#8212; that George Bush will dump Dick Cheney in favour of [Rudy Giuliani as his running mate][1].

It seems that this is analysis mascarading as real news reporting. The only attributed source is &#8220;leading commentator Al Neuharth&#8221;, and the lede is carefully worded so that it does not to suggest that any actual factual information is being reported.

That basic dishonesty aside, this is a solid analysis that makes a good &#8212; and scary &#8212; point. A Bush-Guiliani ticket would be seriously bad news for John Kerry and AN Other. 

Worryingly, Reuters is making [similar noises][2], although they helpfully note that &#8220;far more Democrats than Republicans &#8230; buy into the rumors that Cheney might end up off of the Bush re-election ticket&#8221;.

Reuters also quotes a &#8220;Republican official&#8221; saying that &#8220;There is a better likelihood that I will be abducted by aliens than that Cheney will get dumped from the ticket&#8221;.
