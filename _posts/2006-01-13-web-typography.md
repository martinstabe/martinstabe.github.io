It&#8217;s been out for a month, but I just noticed that **Richard Rutter** has launched [Webtypography.net][1], a site updating **Robert Bringhurst** classic book [*The Elements of Typographic Style* for the web][2]. Most bloggers, including this one, are utterly ignorant of typographic theory &mdash; and our sites look it. I will be subscribing to the RSS feed and will probably learn a lot as the site grows.
