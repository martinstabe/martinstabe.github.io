**Jeff Jarvis** of *Buzzmachine* says &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something very wrong with your life when you start looking on [Saturday as blog catch-up day][1].&rdquo; 

Sunday isn&#8217;t much better, I guess. But following a manic couple of days, here are some quick links to things I have somehow managed to find the time to find interesting over the last two days:

  * Presenting a list of [WMDs that terrorists might want to obtain][2], the head of the *Bundesnachrichtendienst* (BND), Germany&rsquo;s international intelligency agency, says he doesn&rsquo;t think al-Qaeda has managed to obtain nuclear weapons, but that he his concerned about radiological weapons.
  * *The Periscope* notes a provocative *New Statesman* article that says organisations in both Saudi Arabia and the United States are [exporting fundamentalism][3].
  * [**Tony Blair** should be more careful about where he sticks his fingers][4] &mdash; especially when photographers are present.
  * **Matthew Yglesias** has discovered that he [would be a Labour supporter in the British election][5], largely because of Iraq. British readers will find the comments section on this post interesting as an example of how the American centre-left is discussing the British election.
  * Speaking of American perceptions of the election, be sure to check out the *Christian Science Monitor&rsquo;s* take on [MG Rover and the election][6].
  * Looking at the looming referendum in France, the *Monitor* also has a [pro-adoption editorial on the European Constitution][7]:  
    > &#8230; one overarching appeal should be made: The EU and its precursors have successfully overcome the aggressive nationalism that caused so much suffering in the past century. Overall, the EU has proven such a success that other countries are clamoring to join. The constitution &mdash; no, let&rsquo;s say the &ldquo;simplifying treaty&rdquo; &mdash; is the next logical step in this historic experiment.

  * **Timothy Garton Ash** and **Timothy Snyder** have a lengthy piece about [Ukraine&rsquo;s Orange Revolution][8] in the *New York Review of Books.*
  * **Dan Gillmor** has an important post linking to various thoughts on the [changing economics of journalism][9]. 
  * [Via Gillmor][10], I also came across a topical article by **Chris Daly**, a journalism professor at Boston University, entitled [&ldquo;Are Bloggers Journalists? Let&rsquo;s ask Thomas Jefferson&rdquo;][11].
  * [Major sporting events are bad for the environment][12], reports the *New Scientist.* Researchers have found that the 2004 FA Cup final at Cardiff&rsquo;s Millennium Stadium had an ecological footprint of 3,051 hectares.
  * And oh yes: **John Foster** is the first baseball player to have played in both Britain&#8217;s top domestic baseball competition and Major Leagues. While he was a college player in 1997, he spent a summer with my club, the [Brighton Buccaneers][13], before going back to the States and becoming a professional. Following a serious injury last year, he&rsquo;s just been [promoted back to the Major Leagues][14] by the Atlanta Braves.
