The Department for Constitutional Affairs has published a set of recommended response letters to Freedom of Information Act requests ([PDF][1]).

They&rsquo;re intended for civil servants tasked with responding to FOIA requests, but as *Pharmablawg* says, this is [also a valuable resource for requesters][2], allowing them to anticipate likely responses.
