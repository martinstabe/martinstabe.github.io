Tim Porter has [six suggestions for rebuilding journalism][1]. Here&rsquo;s one:

> Reverse the print-online priority equation. Newspapers should be publishing more online than they do in print. Newspapers should be printing content that flows from the web to print, not just the reverse. The virtual newshole, the endless conversation, the involvement of readers, the power of relational advertising &mdash; all are advantages of online that print can never match.
