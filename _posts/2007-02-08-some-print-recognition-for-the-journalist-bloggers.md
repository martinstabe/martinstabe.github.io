As of this week, my new job is my old job. After a couple of months working on a very interesting investigative project, I&#8217;ve returned to the revived *[Press Gazette][1]* as something called &#8220;Content Editor&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, either — except that I&#8217;ll be looking after the web site again.

In today&#8217;s print edition, Pieman [Graham Holliday][2] attempts to dispels the notion that the blogosphere is full of ranting lunatics by giving some old-media link love to the community of journalism bloggers on his — and my — blogroll.

The spread includes profiles of *Greenslade* by [Roy Greenslade][3], *Wordblog* by [Andrew Grant-Adamson][4], [Adrian Monck][5], *Cybersoc* by [Robin Hamman][6], *Sacred Facts* by [Richard Sambrook][7], *Online Journalism Blog* by [Paul Bradshaw][8], *Virtual Economics* by [Seamus McCauley][9], [Shane Richmond][10], *Complete Tosh* by [Neil McIntosh][11], [Andy Dickinson][12], [Richard Burton][13], *Strange Attractor* by [Suw Charman and Kevin Anderson][14] — and the anonymous *[Vickywatch][15].*

**Update:** Seamus makes [a very good observation][16] about the blogroll:

> Odd to think that [Lloyd Shepherd][17] and [Simon Waldman][18], both of whom would surely have been a shoe-in less than a year ago, didn&#8217;t make the list &#8211; presumably because Lloyd wrapped up his blog mid 2006 and Simon posts very rarely these days (though when he does, it&#8217;s a [real doozy][19]). 

Absolutely right — And Lloyd Shepherd&#8217;s new blog also frequently has [great stuff][20].

**Update 9/2/07:** Graham has posted some details about [how he went about producing this][21], and what it all means.
