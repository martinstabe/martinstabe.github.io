Today, I accidentally learned about one of the most radical approaches being used against spam e-mail when my employer became what the *Boston Globe* described as <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/148/business/Collateral_damage_in_the_war_on_spam+.shtml" target="_top">collateral damage</a> in the war on spam. 

The issue is &#8220;blocklisting&#8221; or &#8220;blacklisting&#8221; of IP addresses that are vulnerable to being hijacked by spammers, by organisations like the <a href="http://dsbl.org/main" target="_top">Distributed Server Boycott List</a>. More, no doubt, about this headache anon.
