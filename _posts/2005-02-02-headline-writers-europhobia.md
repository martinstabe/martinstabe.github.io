Sometimes the appearance of knee-jerk Europhobia in British newspapers is not the reporter&rsquo;s fault, but the headline-writing sub-editpr&rsquo;s. Consider [this story][1] by **Isabel Oakshott** in today&rsquo;s London *Evening Standard:*

> TAXPAYERS are facing a huge bill for the foot-and- mouth crisis because of government blunders.
> 
> Ministers have failed to convince agriculture chiefs in Brussels that the huge compensation pay-outs were justified. The European Commission has agreed to pay only &pound;350 million of the &pound;950 million Defra hoped to recoup.
> 
> A new report by the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, reveals that officials at the Ministry of Agriculture &mdash; now known as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) &mdash; authorised huge payments to farmers without verifying the claims.
> 
> In one case, a farmer who paid an average of £60 each for six rams in October 2000 was paid &pound;535 for each animal the following March. In another case, a farmer who paid &pound;14,000 for a bullock in January 2001 received &pound;40,000 when it was slaughtered four months later.
> 
> There are also fears that Defra has failed to make contingency plans for another outbreak following the 2001 epidemic. A total of 6.5million animals were slaughtered, devastating many farms and rural businesses.

Clearly, this is a story about a series of blunders in Britain&rsquo;s national civil service, specifically Defra &mdash; in the handling of foot-and-mouth crisis. So what&rsquo;s the headline?

> **EC REFUSES TO PICK UP &lsquo;FOOT AND MOUTH&rsquo; TAB**

That dastardly Commission &mdash; screwing the British taxpayer again.

**Update:** *The Guardian&rsquo;s* [version of the story][2] explains it a bit better:

> The European Commission has refused to meet 60% of the government&#8217;s £960m claim for costs and compensation because it says Britain paid two to three times the market value for slaughtered animals and was overcharged by contractors culling them. Taxpayers paid £3bn in compensation and to control the outbreak.
