Tory [PPC position available in Slough][1]. Wingnuts need not apply:

> **Adrian Hilton**, a 41-year-old local teacher, became the second Tory candidate to resign in the Labour marginal of Slough &mdash; the first quit after being [photographed with his collection of guns][2]. In a *Spectator* article Mr Hilton [suggested that the European Union was a &ldquo;Papist plot&rdquo;][3] and he was forced to stand down by the party last night, three weeks after his selection.

The odd thing is that a search of the *Spectator* web site indicates that Hilton was writing stuff like this as far back as August 2003.

**Update:** One of the offending Hilton articles is reproduced [here][4]. The folks at ianpaisley.org are [also big fans][5]:

> Adrian Hilton has published a brilliant study *The Principality and Power of Europe,* subtitled *Britain and the Emerging Holy European Empire.* Every British patriot and every Christian should read it. It was published by Dorchester House in 1997. Hilton exposes the emerging Europe as a Vatican plot and links it with the role of the Ecumenical Movement. &#8230;

For more on the views of Rev **Ian Paisley** MEP on the European Union, see &#8220;[EU as Anti-Christ][6]&#8221;

And that&rsquo;s [not the only funny thing][7] about the Tories in Slough:

> A former chairman of Slough Conservatives, recently expelled from his party, has been chosen as a parliamentary candidate for the UK Independence Party.
> 
> **Geoff Howard** was selected on Tuesday by UKIP&rsquo;s Slough and Windsor branch in spite of the reservations of party leaders.

Is there some sort of award for Best Local Party?
