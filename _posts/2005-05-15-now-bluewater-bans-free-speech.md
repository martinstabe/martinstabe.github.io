*Observer* reporter **Katy Weitz** [tried to orchistrate a joint interview with two hoodie-wearing teenagers][1] &mdash; unemployed **Daniel Luchford**, 18, and his friend **Lee**, 17, who did not want to give his surname &mdash; and a hoodie-fearing middle-class couple from Sidcup &mdash; &rdquo;**Cheryl Osborne**, 55, and her husband, **Eric**, 65&rdquo; &mdash; at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.

Bluewater recently banned &mdash; to acclaim from the Government &mdash; baseball caps and hooded sweatshirts in an effort to deter something called anti-social behaviour.

Apparently the shopping centre&rsquo;s authorities also take a pretty dim view of the freedom of the press:

> A security guard wearing a black bomber jacket interrupts to tell us that we are not allowed to conduct an interview on Bluewater property. Suddenly, a common bond is formed between the couples &mdash; Daniel and Lee roll their eyes but do not seem surprised. Eric, however, cannot contain himself: &lsquo;I find this interruption more offensive than any amount of kids wearing hooded tops.
> 
> &lsquo;You can put this in the paper &mdash; this is a nice young gentleman [he gestures towards Daniel], but this [now looking at the guard] is outrageous. I&#8217;m allowed to say what I like to these people. This is my free speech. And you are very rude.&rsquo;
> 
> Eric and Cheryl leave, but not without shaking Daniel&rsquo;s hand again. They ignore the guard, who by now is on his walkie-talkie, summoning back-up. 

Lesson for **Tony Blair** & Co.: Middle England is fearful of hoodie-wearers, but more fearful still of overbearing authority.
