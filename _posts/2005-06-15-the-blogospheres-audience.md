**Chris Bowers** at *MyDD* [highlights][1] a new survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania ([PDF][2]):

> Twenty percent of journalists reported reading a blog almost every day compared to 10 percent of the public.

I wonder what the figures are here in Britain. I suspect it would find similar things. Journalists read blogs more than non-media types. And that, not huge readership figures, is [the real source of bloggers&rsquo; power][3].
