Al-Jazeera has [filed a Freedom of Information Act request][1] with the Cabinet Office, asking for a transcript of the 2004 meeting between **George Bush** and **Tony Blair** during which Bush allegedly suggested bombing the station&rsquo;s headquarters in Qatar. 

When somebody beat them to this approach by nearly a month, [the response was predictable][2] &mdash; although the Cabinet Office admitted holding the requested information, they refused disclosure based on the section 27 (detrimental to international relations) exemption to FOIA.

But *Newsnight* tonight reported that a Downing Street spokesman responded to questions about al-Jazeera&rsquo;s request by [denying that the document contained any reference to bombing al-Jazeera][3]. 

I suspect that when it comes 19 working days from now, the formal FOIA response will look a lot like the one **Steve Wood** received last month ([PDF][4]).
