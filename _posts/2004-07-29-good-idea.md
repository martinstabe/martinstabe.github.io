A group of German journalists are running a blog dedicated to [monitoring and factchecking *Bild*][1], Germany&#8217;s leading popular tabloid.

*Bild* is to Germany what the *Sun* is to Britain, and the blogging journalists are following in the tradition established by [G&uuml;nter Wallraff][2] a crusading investigative reporter who infiltrated the conservative tabloid in 1977 to write a book about it and has been in conflict with the tabloid ever since.
