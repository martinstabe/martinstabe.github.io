Now that Deep Throat, the most most famous confidential source in journalism, has been outed, **Kevin Drum** has a new object for speculation: Who leaked the Downing Street <s>Memo</s> Minutes to the *Sunday Times?* Unlike here in the UK, the [*Times&rsquo;* story on the 2002 meeting in Downing Street][1] about Iraq is now a hot story in the US blogosphere.

Drum points to a story suggesting it could be Sir **Christopher Meyer**, the former UK ambassador to the United States.

The problem with this speculation is that the *Sunday Times* may not know the answer themselves. There is probably no smoke-filled scene in an underground carpark for the movie version of this story. For all we know, a brown envelope just happened to end up at the *Sunday Times&rsquo;* front desk. 

**Update:** *Freiheit und Wissen* [doesn&rsquo;t want to know][2].
