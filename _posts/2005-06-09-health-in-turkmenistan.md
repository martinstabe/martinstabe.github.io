A few weeks ago, the leader of Turkmenistan, **Saparmyrat Niyazov**, announced a plan to shut all the hospitals in the country outside the capital &mdash; [not that you would have noticed in the British media or the blogosphere][1].

That was bad news for a country where the health situation, it turns out, is already pretty abysmal.

According to a new study by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, [life expectancy in Turkmenistan is just 62 years][2], the lowest of any country in Europe or Central Asia.

The BBC reports:

> President Saparmyrat Niyazov has shut nearly all higher education facilities, effectively stopping the training of new doctors and nurses.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> In addition, his other decisions have had a major impact: closing all hospitals outside the capital, abolishing free health care and firing 15,000 health care workers in just one day and replacing them with army conscripts.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> The international community must act now, the scientists say, to make the government improve health care access and stop human rights violations that are increasing public health problems.
