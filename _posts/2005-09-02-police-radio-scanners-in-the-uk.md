*Samizdata* has discovered that you can [listen to the Baton Rouge, Louisiana police scanner on the web][1].

Emergency service radio frequencies are available to the news media in most parts of the United States, and listening to a scanner is part of routine journalism for American crime reporters.

The idea is that it holds police to account, and some journalists&rsquo; organisations are worried about [the effect of digital encryption on this principle of openness][2].

That&rsquo;s Freedom of Information taken seriously. Of course listening in to emergency service broadcasts is [ illegal in the United Kingdom][3] under Section 5(1)(b)(i) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949. 

Scanners themselves are not illegal, but if you do happen to use one to listen to a freqency you are not licensed to receive, it is a seperate offence in 5(1)(b)(ii) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 to disclose to anyone else what you have heard.
