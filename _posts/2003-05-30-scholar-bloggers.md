The *Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217;s* <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39a01401.htm" target="_top">story on scholar-bloggers</a> is out. Some of my favourite names get a mention. 

Since I&#8217;m listed in a directory of such bloggers mentioned in the article, now is a time as any to enter the caveat that I no longer technically qualify for this label. I graduated from the LSE master&#8217;s programme a couple of months ago and am taking some time out of academia while I consider whether or not I want to head back for the PhD stage. So while I still spend a lot of time pondering esoteric theoretical questions, I&#8217;m not really a graduate student any more. I just haven&#8217;t gotten around to changing my damn blogger template.
