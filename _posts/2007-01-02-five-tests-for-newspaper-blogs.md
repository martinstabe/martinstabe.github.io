Andrew Grant-Adamson thinks my assessment of the [*Independent&#8217;s* half-hearted blogging effort][1] was &#8220;almost too kind&#8221; and neatly summarises the long-running debate about the purpose of mainstream news sites&#8217; blogs into [five tests for newspaper blogs][2] to help editors avoid similarly poor results.

Before launching any blog, Grant-Adamson writes, editors should ask:

  1. Does it do anything which cannot better be done in another section of the site?
  2. Does it develop the paperâ€™s interaction with the readers?
  3. Does it gain a valuable audience? (A particular niche, readers who are new to the paper etc)
  4. Can you give the blogger sufficient time to blog successfully?
  5. Have you chosen a writer or writers who have the aptitude to blog successfully?

If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; to any of these questions, it is unlikely to be successful.
