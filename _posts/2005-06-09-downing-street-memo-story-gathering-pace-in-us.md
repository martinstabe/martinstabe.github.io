For weeks now, liberal American [media activists][1], [bloggers][2] (and [some journalists][3]) have been perplexed about why the 2 May [*Sunday Times* story about the 2002 Downing Street memo][4] has not been picked up more widely by American newspapers.

But the [campaign to publicise the story][5] finally seems to be having [some success][6]. With **Tony Blair** in Washington, CNN, the *New York Times* and *Houston Chronicle* all ran stories about the memo on Wednesday.

*CJR Daily* has [a good story of the story][7] &mdash; [as does][8] <srong>Eric Boehlert</strong> at *Salon.com*. *Think Progress* effectively explains [the significance of the memo in American politics][9].
