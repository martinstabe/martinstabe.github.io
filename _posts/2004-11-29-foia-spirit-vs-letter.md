Today&rsquo;s *Daily Telegraph* has an important story about the traditionally secretive British Government&rsquo;s response to the introduction of the UK&rsquo;s Freedom of Information Act, which comes into force on New Year&rsquo;s Day. The lede says it all:

> Government departments have been [shredding record numbers of official files][1] in the months leading up to the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act.

**Update:** The *Telegraph* has a number of additional stories about this, including a [a leader][2] and a comment piece about civil servants&rsquo; secrecy in which **Ben Fenton** [invokes *Yes, Minister*][3]. Fenton also provides some backround with a report on the so-called [&ldquo;Grigg System&rdquo; for records disposal][4].

**Update 2:** The *Scotsman* has a story about the [Scottish FOIA][5], which also comes into force on 1 January 2005.
