In the past week, it emerged that US authorities were worried about the potential [risk of BSE in NATO rations][1] being sent to Katrina victims from Germany. 

That report mentioned that British and Russian supplies were also barred from being distributed in the United States.

Today, the *Mirror* reports that [British NATO ration packs are to be incinerated][2] after the US Department of Agriculture impounded the shipment.

The *Mirror* says food from Spain, Italy and Israel is also being held up as unfit for human consumption.
