For everyone who needs to get up to speed on how blogging is changing contemporary journalism, NYU journalism professor **Jay Rosen**&rsquo;s list of Top Ten Ideas for 2004 is essential reading:

>   1. [The Legacy Media][1].
>   2. [He said, she said, *we said*][1].
>   3. [What the printing press did to the Catholic Church the blogging press does to the media church.][1]
> </a>
> 
>   4. [Open Source Journalism, or: &#8220;My readers know more than I do.&#8221;][2]
>   5. [News turns from a lecture to a conversation][3].
>   6. &#8220;[Content will be more important than its container][4].&#8221;
>   7. &ldquo;What once was good&mdash;or good enough&mdash;no longer is.&rdquo;
>   8. &ldquo;The victory of affinity over geography.&rdquo;
>   9. The Pajamahadeen.
>  10. The Reality-Based Community.

I&#8217;ll add the later links as they become available.
