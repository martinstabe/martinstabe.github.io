A second experimental Twitter mashup sends you [BBC News headlines][1] to you via SMS.

It&#8217;s already improving on last week&#8217;s [CNN mashup][2] by adding a web link to each post. Its creator, Mario Menti, [explains][3].

**Update:** As Graham points out in the comments, the BBC News feed is a little overwhelming. Perhaps the next stage will be a site that lets users customise which news items they want to receive, perhaps using seperate Twitter accounts for different sections of a news site.
